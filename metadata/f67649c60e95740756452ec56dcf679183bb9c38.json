It was a DVD set released in 2008.\n\nThis first one was in 1975, and was John Lennon's last TV interview \nbefore his 5 year &quot;exile&quot; and big comeback in 1980. It was actually \nJohn's portion of that earlier show re-broadcast in December 1980 \nwith new guests who remember Lennon after he was murdered.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f67649c60e95740756452ec56dcf679183bb9c38","amp;dn":"THE+TOMORROW+SHOW+--+John+Lennon+and+his+lawyer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f67649c60e95740756452ec56dcf679183bb9c38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,118,73,198,14,149,116,7,86,69,46,197,109,207,103,145,131,187,156,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
