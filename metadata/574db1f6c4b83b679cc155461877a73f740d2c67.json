For the first time in 100 years, readers will find the original &quot;Songs of Freedom&quot; as well as the 1919 Connolly Souvenir program published in Dublin for a concert commemorating Connolly's birth. Both are reproduced exactly as they originally appeared, providing a fascinating glimpse of the workers' struggle at the beginning of the last century. To complete the picture, it also includes the &quot;James Connolly Songbook of 1972,&quot; which contains not only the most complete selection of Connolly's lyrics but also historical background essential to understanding the context in which the songs were written and performed. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:574db1f6c4b83b679cc155461877a73f740d2c67","amp;dn":"Songs+of+Freedom+by+James+Connolly%2C+et+al","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"574db1f6c4b83b679cc155461877a73f740d2c67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,77,177,246,196,184,59,103,156,193,85,70,24,119,167,63,116,13,44,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
