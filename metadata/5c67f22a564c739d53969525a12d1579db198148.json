Most of the prisoners die. Four of them survive, one of them severely injured. After having killed all the guards, they head for the woods. They take Dr. Douglas Madsen hostage. Suddenly a huge house appears in the middle of the woods. The leader of the group, Arthur, emphasizes that he will kill Douglas and every single member of the &quot;family&quot; if his wounded brother would die. Meanwhile some members of the family show strange behavior, and very soon mayhem breaks loose.\n\nIMDB Review:\n\nLoads of gore, decent effects and unintentionally funny characters made this film just makes it bearable. I had to watch this in 3 different sittings and maybe that's the best way to see it without becoming tired of the story.\n\nThere are events that set off a chain reaction and sets a series of events into motion.\n\nHouse of Blood (called Chain Reaction on the IMDb) is really a pretty terrible movie in many respects. Christopher Kriesa is not that bad an actor, but the rest of the cast is pretty bad (except for what is basically a cameo from Jurgen Prochnow). I think the movie was shot in Germany. The gore effects are pretty bloody for the most part and some are pretty good.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c67f22a564c739d53969525a12d1579db198148","amp;dn":"House+Of+Blood+%28Uncut%29+-+%282003%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c67f22a564c739d53969525a12d1579db198148","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,103,242,42,86,76,115,157,83,150,149,37,161,45,21,121,219,25,129,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
