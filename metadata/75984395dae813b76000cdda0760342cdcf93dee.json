If an element, for example a file on the\nhard drive, is erased, an empty space will occur there\n\nThis empty space is filled again when a new element is saved on\nthe hard drive. If the space isnt big enough, the new element is\nbroken up into fragments. These will then be placed into\ndifferent places on the hard drive to fill empty spaces\n\nAfter some time the PC will need longer to read files, because,\nfirst of all, it has to assemble all fragments. Therefore it is\nvery important to do a defragmentation regularly, in order to to\nmaintain the hard drives performance\n\nAmong the common methods Ashampoo HDD Control 2 uses the\nso-called &quot;proactive&quot; defragmentation, which makes use of your\nwork breaks to analyze the level of disk fragmentation and do a\nfully automatic defragmentation, if necessary\n\nData recovery for emergencies\n\nIts very annoying, if important data are deleted by mistake\nWith Ashampoo HDD Control 2 these files might not be lost\nforever\n\nThe software offers to recover deleted files and folders with the\nintegrated data recovery.
