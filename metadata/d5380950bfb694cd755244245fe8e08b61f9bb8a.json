Even worse, worldwide incidence rates still inexorably escalate. Thus, it is pressing to envisage the extent of the diabetes problem and ensure synergistic approaches aiming in alleviation of its ghastly toll. The chapters of this book report cutting-edge research on molecular events in adiposity and type 2 diabetes, thus opening the way for innovative drug-based therapeutic strategies. It addresses all those who wish to keep in touch with recent developments in the field.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 421 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (March 16, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 364217213X\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3642172137","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5380950bfb694cd755244245fe8e08b61f9bb8a","amp;dn":"Diabetes+-+Perspectives+in+Drug+Therapy+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5380950bfb694cd755244245fe8e08b61f9bb8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,56,9,80,191,182,148,205,117,82,68,36,95,232,224,139,97,249,187,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
