Amy took to the stage of Saint James's church, capacity 85, and \nwowed the small, packed crowd with a searing, acoustic set of songs from Back to Black.\n\nAfter leaving the stage, a relaxed and happy Amy spoke about her music and influences\nMahalia Jackson, Sarah Vaughan, Ray Charles and the Shangri-Las to name a few. Arena \njoined forces with Other Voices and went to Dingle to catch up with some of the people \nthat Amy met on that day, including taxi driver Paddy Kennedy, her bass player Dale Davis \nand Rev Mairt Hanley of the Other Voices church.\n\nThis film showcases not only Amy herself, but the musical geniuses that inspired her to \nforge her own jazz pop style.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/m/vYP9P.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/m/vYP9P.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCredits\n\nSeries Editor - Anthony Wall\n\nDirector - Maurice Linnane\n\nProducer - Philip King\n\nProducer - Tina Moran\n\n\n59mn 16s | 693 MiB | 720x400 | 1635 Kbps | 25.000 fps | AAC | 240 Kbps Vbr | 2 ch | QF 0.196 | pdf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b40d8b71a6a4ac335c3b22ad235cfe96a4e732bf","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Amy+Winehouse+-+She+Came+to+Dingle+2012+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b40d8b71a6a4ac335c3b22ad235cfe96a4e732bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,13,139,113,166,164,172,51,92,59,34,173,35,92,254,150,164,231,50,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
