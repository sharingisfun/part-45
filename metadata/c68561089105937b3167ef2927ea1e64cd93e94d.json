Players choose a vehicle and an arenaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or a series of arenas in the story modeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to engage in battle with opposing drivers. A variety of weapons and upgrades are obtainable by pick-ups scattered throughout the stage. The last driver alive is the winner.\n\nAlthough each individual game features its own storyline, they all revolve around the same basic theme: a man named Calypso hosts a vehicular combat tournament called Twisted Metal with the promise of granting the contest&amp;#039;s winner any single wish they so desire. There is a general &quot;be careful what you wish for&quot; theme, as many of the contestants wind up with not-so-happy endings. The games in the series usually contain a healthy dose of black humor.\n\nI have also included the latest popsplugin and ALL sony prx which are required to play psx-psp conversions on custom firmware&amp;#039;s... To install the pops simply copy the seplugins folder to the root of your memory stick, turn off your psp, hold down the right trigger button while turning the psp back on to go into recovery mode..Select the plugins option and enable the pops...Everytime you start a new psx game it will ask you which pops you wish to use I recommend using 3.40 pops as I have personally have had no problems with ANY psx game so far.....Drag and drop the folder of the game you wish to play to the PSP--&gt;GAME folder on your memory stick and away you go..ENJOY and don&amp;#039;t forget to say thanx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c68561089105937b3167ef2927ea1e64cd93e94d","amp;dn":"%28PSX-PSP%29+Twisted+Metal+1-4%2BSmall+Brawl+converted+properly%28Kingd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c68561089105937b3167ef2927ea1e64cd93e94d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,133,97,8,145,5,147,123,49,103,239,41,39,234,30,100,205,147,233,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
