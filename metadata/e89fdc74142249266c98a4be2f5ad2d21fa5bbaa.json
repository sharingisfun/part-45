He\\\\\\'s also scored the dream like romantic mystery Wicker Park starring Josh Hartnett and Diane Kruger and another criminally underrated film, Narc, directed by Joe Carnahan (The A-Team &amp; Smokin\\\\\\' Aces). For a film like this, Martinez is a rather surprise choice, but surprisingly a good one. This is another album that I honestly didn\\\\\\'t expect all too much out of when I got it, but the more I listened to it, the more I got into it. The music is full melodic atmosphere and it\\\\\\'s a score that will remind most of James Newton Howard\\\\\\'s Michael Clayton, a score that was also mostly atmosphere, but provided a lot of dramatic effect in the process. That wasn\\\\\\'t a perfect score and this one isn\\\\\\'t either, but I honestly rather enjoyed this latest effort by Martinez.\n\nThe music features alot of keyboard rythms and some solid guitar work by Peter Freeman and David Torn, which add up to tension and some dreamy-nightmare beats. You can hear them in tracks like \\\\\\&quot; I Can Kick Your Ass\\\\\\&quot;, \\\\\\&quot;Whose Side Are You On?\\\\\\&quot;, \\\\\\&quot;Shoot Me Right Now\\\\\\&quot;, and \\\\\\&quot;911, What\\\\\\'s Your Emergency?\\\\\\&quot;, which are solid highlights of this tension filled score. There are some very nice meditative tracks as well like \\\\\\&quot;How\\\\\\'s It Hangin\\\\\\' Counselor?\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;We Did A Couple Things Right\\\\\\&quot;, which relives some of the tension brimming every other track with low key synths and keyboards providing a smooth relaxed sound.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
