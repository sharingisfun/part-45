Daniel Atlas, Henley Reeves, Jack Wilder, and Merritt McKinneyÃ¢â‚¬â€are brought together by an unknown benefactor and, one year later, perform in Las Vegas as &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;, sponsored by insurance magnate Arthur Tressler. For the finale, a member of the audience is invited to help them in their next trick: robbing a bank. That member in an audience is Ãƒâ€°tienne Forcier, the account holder at the Credit Republicain de Paris. Forcier is apparently teleported to his bank in Paris, where he activates an air-duct that vacuums up the money and showers it onto the crowd in Las Vegas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da3ee9ddcf86b56238c19eee1a08e2843c0fdb48","amp;dn":"Now+You+See+Me.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da3ee9ddcf86b56238c19eee1a08e2843c0fdb48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,62,233,221,207,134,181,98,56,193,158,238,26,8,226,132,60,15,219,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
