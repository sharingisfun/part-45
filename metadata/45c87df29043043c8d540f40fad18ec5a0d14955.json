Engineers rely on the accuracy, capacity, and performance of HFSS to design on-chip embedded passives, IC packages, PCB interconnects, antennas, RF/microwave components, and biomedical devices.\n\nHFSS improves engineering productivity, reduces development time, and better assures first-pass design success. HFSS v11 can solve complex geometries 2-5X faster and use half the memory, allowing users to expand beyond what they ever thought possible with simulation technology. Additionally, HFSS v11 includes new automation features, user-interface refinement, and data linking capability, making it easy to design, simulate, and validate complex high-performance RF, microwave, and millimeter-wave devices, high-speed channels, and complete power-delivery systems in modern, high-performance electronics.\n\nNew in HFSS v11\n\n    * New higher-order hierarchical basis functions combined with an iterative solver provides accurate fields, smaller meshes, and efficient solutions for large multi-wavelength structures.\n    * Enhanced port solver: HFSS can simulate lower frequencies than before and will have a lower noise floor.\n    * Floquet Ports: these periodic ports enable designers of phased-array antennas and frequency-selective surfaces to obtain separate fields into modes for better understanding and examine phase information for each mode.\n    * OptimetricsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ now offers genetic algorithm\n    * New Auto-assign capability for terminals\n    * Complex geometries solve 2-5X faster using half the memory with the new v11 fault tolerant, high-quality finite element mesher\n    * Expanded Distributed Solve Option\n          o Automatic Distributed Solve of discrete and interpolating frequency sweeps\n          o Now available for parametric sweeps, optimization, sensitivity analysis, and statistical analysis \n    * Improved Dynamic Links SIwave-HFSS and HFSS-HFSS\n          o Link is now based on both E- and H-field; greater accuracy in case of enforced field in HFSS-HFSS link \n    * New report editor for better usability\n    * Feature-rich 2D plots","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45c87df29043043c8d540f40fad18ec5a0d14955","amp;dn":"Ansoft+HFSS+11+%2B+PROJECTS+WITH+FULL+CRAK+ACTIVATION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45c87df29043043c8d540f40fad18ec5a0d14955","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,200,125,242,144,67,4,60,141,84,15,64,250,209,142,197,160,209,73,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
