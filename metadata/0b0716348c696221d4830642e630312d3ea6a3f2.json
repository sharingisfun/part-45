A single released in August 1972, &quot;Standing in the Road&quot;, reached number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. Lack of further tangible success left them labelled as one-hit wonders. However, they did have another record enter the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Sing Don't Speak&quot; reached number 36 in December 1972. In November 1972, they appeared on the German television programme, Disco. According to Allmusic, &quot;they were written off as a teen sensation and broke up in 1977&quot;.\n\nLater incarnations\nThe band stopped performing live in 1977, but under the name Liner recorded a studio album, Liner, in 1979. Released on Atlantic Records, and produced by Arif Mardin, it was recorded in both the UK and the U.S., using session musicians from both sides of the Atlantic, including Mel Collins, Dick Morrissey, Frank Vicari and Ronnie Cuber on saxophones; plus Cissy Houston, Maretha Stewart and Beverly Ingram on background vocals. The fourth member of the original band, Alan Jones, later emigrated to Sydney, Australia. By 1984, they had formed as a trio, Outside Edge, recording a further four albums under that name. In 1993, the band went back on the road, modifying the original Blackfoot Sue to BFS.  &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfoot_Sue&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfoot_Sue&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracklist:\n01.
