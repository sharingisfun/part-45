While not quite at the &quot;sheets of sound&quot; unfettered music he would make before his passing in 1967, there are hints of this group stretching out in restrained dynamics, playing as lovely a progressive jazz as heard anywhere in any time period.\r\n\r\nThe highlights come at the top with the reverent, ruminating, and free ballad &quot;Crescent,&quot; with a patient Coltrane acquiescing to swinging, while the utterly beautiful &quot;Wise One&quot; is accented by the delicate and chime-like musings of Tyner with a deeply hued tenor from Coltrane unrushed even in a slight Latin rhythm. These are the ultimate spiritual songs, and ultimately two of the greatest in Coltrane's storied career. But &quot;Bessie's Blues&quot; and &quot;Lonnie's Lament&quot; are just as revered in the sense that they are covered by jazz musicians worldwide, the former a hard bop wonder with a classic short repeat chorus, the latter one of the most somber, sad jazz ballad reflections in a world full of injustice and unfairness â€“ the ultimate eulogy. \r\n\r\nGarrison and especially Jones are put through their emotional paces, but on the finale &quot;The Drum Thing,&quot; the African-like tom-tom sounds extracted by Jones with Coltrane's sighing tenor, followed by some truly amazing case study-frantic snare drumming, makes it one to be revisited. In the liner notes, a quote from Leroi Jones/Amiri Baraka states John Coltrane was &quot;daringly human,&quot; and no better example of this quality transferred to musical endeavor is available than on this definitive, must have album that encompasses all that he was and eventually would become.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Crescent\r\n02 - Wise One\r\n03 - Bessie's Blues\r\n04 - Lonnie's Lament\r\n05 - The Drum Thing\r\n\r\n*2008 Impulse! / Verve / UMG | Verve Originals Series | 0602517649026 | LP AS-66\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nJohn Coltrane - tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone\r\nMcCoy Tyner - piano\r\nJimmy Garrison - bass\r\nElvin Jones - drums\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Coltrane - The 1961 Newport Set (2012) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/13297309/John_Coltrane_-_The_1961_Newport_Set_%282012%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Coltrane - Live At Birdland (1963) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n  \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/13255289/John_Coltrane_-_Live_At_Birdland_%281963%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Coltrane and Johnny Hartman - John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman (1963) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n   \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/13221874/John_Coltrane_and_Johnny_Hartman_%281963%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuke Ellington &amp; John Coltrane - Duke Ellington &amp; John Coltrane (1962)[EAC-FLAC]\r\n      \nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9762992/Duke_Ellington__amp__John_Coltrane_-_Duke_Ellington__amp__Coltra\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Coltrane - The Other Village Vanguard Tapes (1961) [2CD][EAC-FLAC]:\r\n     \nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8917985/John_Coltrane_-_The_Other_Village_Vanguard_Tapes_(1961)_[EAC-FLA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Coltrane - Afro Blue Impressions (1963) [2CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n   \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9832444/John_Coltrane_-_Afro_Blue_Impressions_%281963%29_%5B2CD%5D_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Coltrane - Africa Brass (1961) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n  \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/12638655/John_Coltrane_-_Africa_Brass_%281961%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Coltrane - Live At Temple University (2014) [2CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n  \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11312942/John_Coltrane_-_Live_At_Temple_University_%282014%29_%5B2CD%5D_%5BEAC-FLAC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThelonious Monk - With John Coltrane (1961) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n  \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8773056/Thelonious_Monk_-__With_John_Coltrane_%281961%29__%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Coltrane - Blue Train (1957) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n  \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10697494/John_Coltrane_-_Blue_Train_%281957%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D__2014_Japan_SHM-CD_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Coltrane - Sun Ship: The Complete Session (2013)[2CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n    \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10807404/John_Coltrane_-_Sun_Ship__Complete_Session_%282013%29_%5B2CD%5D_%5BEAC-FLA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d47876e7bbd7166729743fed2fb3dc904a4ff27","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+Quartet+-+Crescent+%281964%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d47876e7bbd7166729743fed2fb3dc904a4ff27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,71,135,110,123,189,113,102,114,151,67,254,210,251,61,201,4,164,255,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
