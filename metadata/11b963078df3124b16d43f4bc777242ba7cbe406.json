When \nLevi Wise, a charming rogue who&amp;#039;s secretly on the wrong side of the law, \njoins the house, the delicate balance of the flat is upset in one swoop. The \nblack and white line between right and wrong becomes increasingly blurred \nwith shades of grey, as the &amp;#039;upholders of the law&amp;#039; struggle with their \ninextricably entwined professional dilemmas and personal lives.\n\nAward-winning writer David Brechin-Smith says the series has three main \nthemes - loyalty, morality and transition. &quot;Loyalty to your friends, to \nyourself and to your partner. The show explores how these different loyalties \nare often in conflict.\n\n&quot;We all have a line between right and wrong. We&amp;#039;re usually on the &amp;#039;right&amp;#039; \nside of the line, but sometimes we cross the line. Of the five main \ncharacters, three are cops. What happens when someone who upholds the law \ncommits a terrible crime and realises they might get away with it? How do you \nreconcile being both a good guy and a bad guy?&quot;\n\nHe says the series has a good balance of dramatic elements. &quot;It&amp;#039;s funny, sad, \npoignant, uplifting, surprising. We even have some action sequences! And many \nmoments of black humour.&quot;\n\nThe cast includes Ryan O&amp;#039;Kane, who won Best Actor at the 2006 Qantas \nTelevision Awards.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNot my capture.
