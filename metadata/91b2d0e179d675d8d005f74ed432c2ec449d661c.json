The veteran MC teamed up with L.A. singer/songwriter/rapper Lana Shea in 2011 to form the group Luck&amp;Lana, which has been described as a mini dream team with talent that is just exploding out the eyesockets (Trapstyle.com). By mixing elements of hiphop, dubstep, soul, pop and electro, combined with their hard-hitting live show, the duo has come together like a Hip Hop/Dubstep Bonnie and Clyde (TheKitchenMix.com) and is turning heads from the LA underground to the blogosphere.\n\nGold was struck when Luck&amp;Lana linked up with Kill The Computer, an EDM production team also out of L.A. What began as one song, Bang Bang (which can be found on Luckyiam's most recent release, &quot;Time To Get Lucky&quot;), led to another and then another. Finally, a full-length album of EDM- infused hiphop with dirty bass, clean bars and soulful hooks was born.\n\n\npLEASE SEED AND ENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91b2d0e179d675d8d005f74ed432c2ec449d661c","amp;dn":"Luck+%26amp%3B+Lana+Kill+The+Computer-+mp3+%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91b2d0e179d675d8d005f74ed432c2ec449d661c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,178,208,225,121,214,117,216,208,5,247,78,212,50,194,236,68,157,102,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
