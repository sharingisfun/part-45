Transfer &gt;&gt;whole&lt;&lt; XBMC folder to Xbox. Overwrite &gt;&gt;UserData&lt;&lt; folder with your backed up copy.\n\n\n_DASHBOARD INSTALL (SOFTMODS)_______________________________________________\n\tARE NOT COVERED IN THIS README, SEE http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?showtopic=406656\n\n\n_DASHBOARD INSTALL__________________________________________________________\n\tOption 1. Team XBMC's shortcut tool. \n\tIt's included in the _tools folder as &gt;&gt;SHORTCUT by TEAM XBMC.xbe&lt;&lt; + &gt;&gt;SHORTCUT by TEAM XBMC.cfg&lt;&lt;.\n\tInstructions here: http://xbmc.org/wiki/?title=As_a_Dashboard (Option 1).\n\tRename the &gt;&gt;SHORTCUT by TEAM XBMC.xbe&lt;&lt;+.cfg &amp; also EDIT the .cfg so it matches your config. \n\tSee APPLICATION INSTALL above.\n\n\tOption 2. Thanks to an app called &gt;&gt;Team UIX's Xbe Shortcut Maker v1.0&lt;&lt; by JbOnE, it's now easy...\n\tTransfer contents of XBMC folder (this is &gt;&gt;VERY&lt;&lt; important since the tool is hardcoded) TO &gt;&gt;/E:/APPS/XBMC/&lt;&lt;. \n\tRename &gt;&gt;SHORTCUT by TEAM UIX.xbe&lt;&lt; to something your bios can boot (see http://xbmc.org/wiki/?title=As_a_Dashboard or read your BIOS README) and transfer to location your mod solution boots. No need to fiddle with HOME tag anymore, and future upgrades you need not to worry about this file (unless you move XBMC).\n\n\n_AN INTRODUCTION TO PLUGINS_________________________________________________\n\tXBMC has a system for Media plugins to allow browsing of remote content (Internet) using the regular filesystem approach.\n\tPlugins are put inside &gt;&gt;XBMC/plugins/&lt;video/music/pictures&gt;/&lt;&lt; (I already do this for the one/s I include),\n\tfurthermore they also need to be installed as a source in (video/music/pictures).\n\tYou do this install by using the contextmenu choice &gt;&gt;Add New Source&lt;&lt; while in ROOT list and then choosing ***Plugins as source.\n\tThen you highlight (not select) the folder of the plugin you want to install. It will be saved inside sources.xml for future.\n\n\n_UPGRADE TIPS_______________________________________________________________\n\tIf you're updating from a VERY old/bad build you may get issues. Follow these simple rules:\n\to Replace (FTP OVERWRITE) all files in your XBMC folder with fresh ones from your new build (sometimes you need to delete old files)\n\to Delete old settings (from &gt;&gt;UserData/guisettings.xml&lt;&lt;)\n\to In some rare cases some of the database files in &gt;&gt;/UserData/Database/*.db&lt;&lt; may need manual deletion (usually if they are very old). Note: This loses all per file settings you made with the old build!\n\n\n_TWEAKS BY T3CH_____________________________________________________________\n\tI'm including a prepared &gt;&gt;favourites.xml&lt;&lt; that has all my included scripts. Don't handedit this file, use GUI to add/move/remove items.\n\n\n_LAST WORDS_________________________________________________________________\n\tWho is T3CH? - Revealed on a -need to know basis-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f3447205f63bdd9142fe2e6beaa1006d761db4f","amp;dn":"XBMC-9.04.1-FIXED-BABYLON-T3CH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f3447205f63bdd9142fe2e6beaa1006d761db4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,52,71,32,95,99,189,217,20,47,226,230,190,170,16,6,215,97,219,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
