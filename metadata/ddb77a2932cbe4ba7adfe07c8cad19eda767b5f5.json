By continually challenging the reader to answer probing questions throughout the book, the Move by Move format greatly encourages the learning and practising of vital skills just as much as the traditional assimilation of opening knowledge.\n\nCarefully selected questions and answers are designed to keep you actively involved and allow you to monitor your progress as you learn. This is an excellent way to study any chess opening and at the same time improve your general chess skills and knowledge.\n\nThe King's Indian Attack is a very popular system of development for White, which can be used against many defences. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to learn and play, and is based on understanding ideas rather than move memorization. The King's Indian Attack usually involves a deliberate and sustained attack on the black king, which often proves to be highly effective and difficult to defend against. In this book Grandmaster Neil McDonald examines in depth the many variations of the King's Indian Attack. He outlines White's most promising options and BlackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best defences, and provides answers to all the key questions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddb77a2932cbe4ba7adfe07c8cad19eda767b5f5","amp;dn":"The+King%27s+Indian+Attack%3A+Move+by+Move","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddb77a2932cbe4ba7adfe07c8cad19eda767b5f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,183,122,41,50,203,228,186,122,223,224,124,140,173,25,237,167,103,181,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
