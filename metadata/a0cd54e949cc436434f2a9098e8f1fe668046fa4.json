To me, there are few musical alliances more pleasing than a guitar/organ/drums trio that sounds terrific and swings like a metronome, as this one does. If there's anything that could enrich the partnership, that would certainly include inviting an eloquent and powerful tenor saxophonist such as Alexander to sit in, which Kjekstad does on four numbers Ã¢â‚¬â€ Stanley Turrentine's bluesy &quot;Sugar&quot; and three of his svelte original compositions, &quot;Prospect Park S.W.&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn Bound&quot; and &quot;Over Easy&quot;.\n\nKjekstad has impressive chops and a warm, resonant sound, which Smith's Hammond B-3 complements superbly, while Landham keeps perceptive and tasteful time. Alexander fits in snugly on his cameos, broadening the trio's horizons while adding spice to the basic recipe. \n\nAs for role models, Kjekstad drops a broad hint with the inclusion of Wes Montgomery's ambling &quot;Road Song&quot;, on which he pays homage to Wes's groundbreaking style. Rounding out the admirable program are the standards &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;, &quot;Secret Love&quot;, &quot;Laura&quot; and of course, &quot;Autumn in New York&quot;. I was especially charmed by the swaying, Jobim-like treatment of &quot;Secret Love&quot;, which embodies typically persuasive solos by Kjekstad and Smith.\n\n--------\n\nL Hammond, The Pirate Bay, where you'll find more jazz organ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0cd54e949cc436434f2a9098e8f1fe668046fa4","amp;dn":"Frode+Kjekstad+-+New+York+Time+-+Jazz+Guitar%2C+Organ+Lonnie+Smith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0cd54e949cc436434f2a9098e8f1fe668046fa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,205,84,233,73,204,67,100,52,242,169,9,142,143,31,230,104,4,111,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
