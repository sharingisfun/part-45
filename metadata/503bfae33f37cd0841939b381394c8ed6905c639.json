The show features auctioneer Dan Dotson, as well as auction hunters Dave Hester, Darrell Sheets, Barry Weiss, and Jarrod Schulz. When rent is not paid on a storage locker for three months in California, the contents are sold by an auctioneer as a single lot of items. The show follows professional buyers who purchase the contents based only on a 5 minute inspection and what they can see only from the door when it is opened. The goal is to turn a profit on the merchandise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:503bfae33f37cd0841939b381394c8ed6905c639","amp;dn":"Storage.Wars.S02E02.Trouble.The.Oil.HDTV.XviD-sHoTV.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"503bfae33f37cd0841939b381394c8ed6905c639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,59,250,227,63,55,205,8,65,147,155,56,19,148,200,237,105,5,198,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
