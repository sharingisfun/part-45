The Paris Concert is recommended to all true Coltrane fanatics. \n\n01 - Mr. P.C.\n02 - The Inch Worm\n03 - Ev\\'rytime We Say Goodbye\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84a559fc6d92140900535717b3dad0dbc3c415e8","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+The+Paris+Concert+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84a559fc6d92140900535717b3dad0dbc3c415e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,165,89,252,109,146,20,9,0,83,87,23,179,218,208,219,195,196,21,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
