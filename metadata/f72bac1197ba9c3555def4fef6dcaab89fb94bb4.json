A hero born, murdered, and born again. When a Rookie cop named Denny Colt returns from the beyond as The Spirit, a hero whose mission is to fight against the bad forces from the shadows of Central City. The Octopus who kills anyone unfortunate enough to see his face who has other plans. He's going to wipe out the entire city. The Spirit tracks this cold hearted killer from the city's rundown warehouses, to the damp catacombs, to the windswept waterfront all the while facing a bevy of beautiful women who either want to seduce, love or kill the masked crusader.\n\nHonestly, I havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t had the time to even watch this film yet, other than to skip through and make sure it stays in sync with the audio, but it looks great and interesting.  And so far, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve liked everything else IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve read or seen that came from the mind of Frank Miller, plus, Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain, so it canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be TOO bad!  I converted this file using the 720p HD Blu-Ray rip as the source and used a higher than average bitrate and large resolution to bring you the biggest and best iPod-capable H.264 MP4 youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re gonna find, all packed into a quite reasonably-sized file.  Enjoy!\n\nOne more note ... someone requested Ip Man in this new encoding format, which requires subtitles.  My first attempt encoding Ip Man was successful, but when tagging the file, I believe I corrupted it, so I'll have to start all over again.  So expect Ip Man sometime next week in this encoding format with burned in subtitles.\n\nSCREEN SHOTS: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/thespirit.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/thespirit.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Additional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!  Album Art, Release Dates, and TV Tags are already filled out for you.  However, if you wish to change them, I recommend the third-party tagging program TVTagger.\n\nAfter downloading, please leave your client open and the torrent actively seeding so others may download as well and your ratio will remain high!  Also remember not to severely limit your upload speed by over-throttling.  Be kind, rewind!  Remember to eat your green vegetables.
