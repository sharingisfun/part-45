Also, establishing relevance to the world of student's is crucial and this text does a very good job in this area.&quot; - Stephen Godleski, The College at Brockport, SUNY\n\n&quot;McMurry is very clearly organized. Students find it readable, which is a remarkable accomplishment. The McMurry text has excellent problems and connects well to students interested in the biochemical and medicinal applications of organic chemistry. Although different from most other texts on the market, the introduction of alkene and alkyne reactions prior to substitution/elimination reactions is easily manageable, and in fact simpler, thus providing a smooth entry into organic reactions for new students. McMurry has excellent spectra and makes good use of color. Theelectrostatic potential maps are helpful at times.&quot;- Ernest G. Nolen, Colgage University\nProduct Description\nMaster organic chemistry with the help of this proven bestseller! John McMurry's Organic Chemistry is consistently praised as the most clearly written book available for the course. In John McMurry's words: &quot;I wrote this book because I love writing. I get great pleasure and satisfaction from taking a complicated subject, turning it around until I see it clearly from a new angle, and then explaining it in simple words.&quot; Through his lucid writing and ability to show the beauty and logic of organic chemistry, McMurry makes learning enjoyable. The highest compliment that can be given to a chemistry book applies to McMurry: It works!\n\nAbout This Edition\n\nThe most trusted and best-selling text for organic chemistry just got better! Updated with the latest developments, expanded with more end-of-chapter problems, reorganized to cover stereochemistry earlier, and enhanced with OWL, the leading online homework and learning system for chemistry, John McMurry's Organic Chemistry continues to set the standard for the course. The eighth edition also retains McMurry's hallmark qualities: comprehensive, authoritative, and clear. McMurry has developed a reputation for crafting precise and accessible texts that speak to the needs of instructors and students. More than a million students worldwide from a full range of universities have mastered organic chemistry through his trademark style, while instructors at hundreds of colleges and universities have praised his approach time and time again.\nNew Features\n\n    * Improved Chapter-Ending Problem Organization.\n      End-of-chapter problems are now grouped by type to assist professors in assigning problems and students in solving them.\n\n    * Earlier Coverage of Stereochemistry.\n      Stereochemistry now appears earlier in the book (Chapter 5) to get to this important topic sooner in the course. In addition, CahnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“IngoldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Prelog sequence rules are now introduced in Section 5.5.\n\n    * Revised Coverage of Fundamental Topics.\n      The revision of activation energies in multi-step reactions and the update of all bond dissociation energies in Chapter 6 helps students to better understand this fundamental topic.\n\n    * Revised End-of-Chapter Questions In OWL.\n      The integrated OWL online learning system now includes more parameterized end-of-chapter questions, encouraging students to practice multiple questions of the same type with different chemicals, wording, and numbers to ensure their mastery of the underlying chemical concepts. OWL also includes an interactive e-version of the textbook, enhanced with rich multimedia learning tools and available 24/7 in OWL.\n\n    * Revised &quot;Focus On&quot; Boxes.\n      These end-of-chapter boxes now present interesting applications of organic chemistry relevant to the particular chapter.\n\n    * Updated Figures.\n      To better coordinate legends with art, step numbers have been added to the legends of all mechanism figures. In addition, all figure references have been more clearly keyed to illustrations via color.\n\n    * New Supplement.\n      Spartan Model: An Electronic Model Kit is now available to package with the eighth edition for those who want to use this advanced technology resource.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 1376 pages\n# Publisher: Brooks Cole; 8 edition (January 1, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0840054440\n# ISBN-13: 978-0840054449\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e20c9579fcd5072eb99e2bbcf17b4a80591b1f2a","amp;dn":"Organic+Chemistry+%2C8th+Edition+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e20c9579fcd5072eb99e2bbcf17b4a80591b1f2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,12,149,121,252,213,7,46,185,158,43,188,241,123,74,128,89,27,31,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
