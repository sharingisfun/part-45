The book was published in 1989, and this audio book was produced by Books on Tape, Inc in 1990.  This book has 6 parts and 33 chapters, and was read by Bill Kelsey.\n\nThis audiobook has been out of print for many years and very hard to find.  Furthermore, it was available only on cassette (which was the standard at the time), so even when found, it was of limited usefulness.  Being one of Keegan's earliest audiobooks, it also became out of print sooner, hence its rarity.  I hope students of military history, and Keegan fans in particular, will enjoy this audiobook as much as I have.\n\nIn converting to mp3, I have organized the files by chapter (rather than the original cassette boundaries), so there are 33 files in all.  Note that this audiobook does not reproduce any of the pictures or graphics from the original book, so it may be helpful to have the physical book available to look at as well.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nPROLOGUE\nChapter 1: Every Man a Soldier\nChapter 2: Fomenting World War\n\nPART I: THE WAR IN THE WEST 1940-1943\nChapter 3: The Triumph of Blitzkrieg\nChapter 4: Air Battle: The Battle of Britain\nChapter 5: War Supply and the Battle of the Atlantic\n\nPART II: THE WAR IN THE EAST 1941-1943\nChapter 6: Hitler's Strategic Dilemma\nChapter 7: Securing the Eastern Springboard\nChapter 8: Airborne Battle: Crete\nChapter 9: Barbarossa\nChapter 10: War Production\nChapter 11: Crimean Summer, Stalingrad Winter\n\nPART III: THE WAR IN THE PACIFIC 1941-1943\nChapter 12: Tojo's Strategic Dilemma\nChapter 13: From Pearl Harbor to Midway\nChapter 14: Carrier Battle: Midway\nChapter 15: Occupation and Repression\nChapter 16: The War for the Islands\n\nPART IV: THE WAR IN THE WEST 1943-1945\nChapter 17: Churchill's Strategic Dilemma\nChapter 18: Three Wars in Africa\nChapter 19: Italy and the Balkans\nChapter 20: Overlord\nChapter 21: Tank Battle: Falaise\nChapter 22: Strategic Bombing\nChapter 23: The Ardennes and the Rhine\n\nPART V: THE WAR IN THE EAST 1943-1945\nChapter 24: Stalin's Strategic Dilemma\nChapter 25: Kursk and the Recapture of Western Russia\nChapter 26: Resistance and Espionage\nChapter 27: The Vistula and the Danube\nChapter 28: City Battle: The Siege of Berlin\n\nPART VI: THE WAR IN THE PACIFIC 1943-1945\nChapter 29: Roosevelt's Strategic Dilemma\nChapter 30: Japan's Defeat in the South\nChapter 31: Amphibious Battle: Okinawa\nChapter 32: Super-Weapons and the Defeat of Japan\nChapter 33: The Legacy of the Second World War\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4587013bb068950fa1c0919409d2a0e2f3081662","amp;dn":"Second+World+War+-+John+Keegan+%28Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4587013bb068950fa1c0919409d2a0e2f3081662","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,135,1,59,176,104,149,15,161,192,145,148,9,210,160,226,243,8,22,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
