It was founded in 1969 by guitarist Jukka Tolonen and drummer Vesa Aaltonen. Other founder members were MÃƒÂ¥ns Groundstroem (bass) and Frank Robson (vocals), previously of Blues Section. Juhani Aaltonen (saxophone/flute) had earlier played in Soulset; he was replaced in 1970 by Pekka PÃƒÂ¶yry. Eero Raittinen replaced Robson as a vocalist in 1972, the same year as the album Lambertland was released in UK. The album was a tight fusion of jazz and folk rock with highly inventive and imaginative lyrics which charted at the number 7 position in Finland. Milky Way Moses reached number 12 in Finland in 1974. Tasavallan Presidentti disbanded that same year, then reunited from 2005-06.\n\nTaitaa tuosta joku albumi puuttuakin, niin ja oikeestihan nÃƒÂ¤itÃƒÂ¤ pitÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ kuunnella vinyyliltÃƒÂ¤.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b500416ec20db20b71eeac09bce2c04727a3b4bb","amp;dn":"Tasavallan+Presidentti+-+SuomiProgea+-+Finnish+Progressive+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b500416ec20db20b71eeac09bce2c04727a3b4bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,0,65,110,194,13,178,11,113,238,172,9,188,226,192,71,39,163,180,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
