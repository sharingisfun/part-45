Director Joseph Losey and writer Harold Pinter had previously collaborated on 1963's The Servant, and they surrounded this recasting of a Nicholas Mosley novel with a similar atmosphere of ominous mystery. The story is presented through flashbacks and disconnected memories that trace the characters'\ninteractions. Though the mood is occasionally brightened by satirical views of the academic world, the overall effect is rather somber, concerned with missed opportunities, unhealthy obsessions, and unavoidable regret. Dirk Bogarde superbly captures the pensive professor's torment, with able support from Jacqueline Sassard and Michael York as the younger couple.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Accident.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 697 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 40mn\n      Bit rate : 956 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 12.4 MiB\n      Writing application : Nandub v1.0rc2\n      Writing library : Nandub build 1852/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 40mn\n      Bit rate : 868 Kbps\n      Width : 576 pixels\n      Height : 336 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.178\n      StreamSize : 627 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      PlayTime : 1h 40mn\n      Bit rate : 79 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 57.3 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.93 \n      Encoding settings : VBR (rh)\n\nEnglish audio, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5261f7aed68244dc11c1cb6b53665099256e6454","amp;dn":"Accident","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5261f7aed68244dc11c1cb6b53665099256e6454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,97,247,174,214,130,68,220,17,193,203,107,83,102,80,153,37,110,100,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
