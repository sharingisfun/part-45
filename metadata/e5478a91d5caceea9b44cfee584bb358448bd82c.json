Now, The Woman Lit by Fireflies, one of his best-loved books, is available as a Grove paperback.\n\nAcross the odd contours of the American landscape, people are searching for the things that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t irretrievably lost, for the incandescent beneath the ordinary. An ex-Bible student with raucously asocial tendencies rescues the preserved body of an Indian chief from the frigid depths of Lake Superior in a caper that nets a wildly unexpected bounty. A band of sixties radicals, now approaching middle age, reunite to free an old comrade from a Mexican jail. A fifty-year-old suburban housewife flees quietly from her abusive businessman husband at a highway rest stop, climbs a fence, and explores the bittersweet pageant of the preceding years within the sanctuary of an Iowa cornfield.\n\nThe Woman Lit by Fireflies is the work of a classic writer at the very top of his form--a hard-living, hard-writing hero of American letters whose novellas comprise a sweeping tribute to the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heartland and the colorful, courageous characters who inhabit it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5478a91d5caceea9b44cfee584bb358448bd82c","amp;dn":"Jim+Harrison+-+A+Woman+Lit+By+Fireflies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5478a91d5caceea9b44cfee584bb358448bd82c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,71,138,145,213,202,206,234,155,68,207,238,88,75,179,88,68,139,216,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
