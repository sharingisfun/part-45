Consequently, there is a need for different strategies to address wastewater treatment and subsequent reuse, especially in arid and semi-arid areas where water shortages are the rule. Biological treatment processes constitute crucial tools in the biodegradation of organic matter, transformation of toxic compounds into harmless products, and nutrient removal in wastewater microbiology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdited by a professor of genetics and microbiology with extensive research, this compendium provides an overview of the most current research into many facets of wastewater bioremediation. The book is broken into three sections: microbial communities for wastewater treatment, environmental factors, and treatments. It provides discussions on biological treatment processes for different types of wastewater, such as municipal wastewater and wastewater from tanneries; how environmental factors such as season dynamics affect the diversity of bacteria; and applications and treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe range of topics presented will be valuable for biological engineers and others involved with wastewater management. Researchers will find a wealth of studies that will prove fruitful for future investigation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c90b83734d1ecea315027848db7120825e17998f","amp;dn":"Bioremediation+of+Wastewater+-+Factors+and+Treatments","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c90b83734d1ecea315027848db7120825e17998f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,11,131,115,77,30,206,163,21,2,120,72,219,113,32,130,94,23,153,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
