Wilson was living in the Blue House, an infamous Raleigh crash pad and romper room for the areas hottest young musicians. The other members are banjo picker Chandler Holt, upright bassist Greg Readling, and multi-instrumentalist John Teer. Wilson and Readling were playing in the Blue House as &quot;Stillhouse&quot; when Teer and Holt became intrigued &quot;to hear these guys playing original country music that didn't suck&quot; as Holt recalls. Holt and Teer befriended Wilson at the Blue House and began sitting in with the band.
