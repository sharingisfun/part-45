Many commentators are giving her the mantle of the new flamenco starlet. Yet on this LP she proves - guided by the sensitive and poignant direction of producer Javier LimÃƒâ€˜Ã†â€™n - that she can lend her sun-drenched, oaky voice both to the traditional and the fusion. \n\nEmbellished by LimÃƒâ€˜Ã†â€™n's purposeful guitar and the exquisitely adroit piano playing of Ivan Lewis, her third album is really a pleasure to behold. Produced with understanding and wisdom, LimÃƒâ€˜Ã†â€™n allows Buika to express her inner anguish, adding lines and chords to coax her into further introspection. \n\nTheir rendition of Volver Volver is notable for this, as is the tender, self-penned MiÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹nteme Bien. Accompanied by Lewis, whose light touch and sense of gaiety cleverly adds an almost swing-like foil, the mournful Concha is now a clear distance from the hotels of Las Vegas or the house clubs of Mallorca. \n\nThe title track, originally written by Caracol, puts Buika around the campfire, warming to her past and maybe her roots; more soulful and eased along by muted trumpet. In a sense this is new flamenco, but Culpa Mia shows her ability to adapt rhythmically. From the palmas intro to the gypsy-like rumba ending, the track triumphs in its anticipation of a climax, only to be knowingly faded out by LimÃƒâ€˜Ã†â€™n. The effect is an almost forced contemplation of the gravitas of ensuing MiÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹nteme Bien.\n\nThe troupe becomes the sums of its parts with No HabrÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â± Nadie En El Mundo, and floats to the arabesque and beyond with VolverÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â±s. However, MarÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â½a ConcepciÃƒâ€˜Ã†â€™n Balboa Buika is at her most poignant when exposed with only LimÃƒâ€˜Ã†â€™n or Lewis as accompaniment. Looking beyond the mirror, she funnels her essence into her voice. Other critics have compared her with Simone, Vaughn or even Gray. Earnest she is, and maybe being a late developer the Schadenfreude will come later. Until then she has no need to do it any other way.\n--- BBC music reviews\n\nTracks\n01- La falsa moneda\n02- Culpa mia\n03- Mienteme bien\n04- La nina de fuego\n05- Arboles de agua\n06- La niebla\n07- No habraÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â  nadie en el mundo\n08- Volver, volver\n09- Volveras\n10- Mentirosa\n11- Hay en la luz\n\nArtwork, EAC log and CUE sheet included\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f19edceb7d1920d3f344aa5b3737384b57a30ab5","amp;dn":"Buika+-+Nina+De+Fuego+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f19edceb7d1920d3f344aa5b3737384b57a30ab5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,158,220,235,125,25,32,211,243,68,170,91,55,55,56,75,87,163,10,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
