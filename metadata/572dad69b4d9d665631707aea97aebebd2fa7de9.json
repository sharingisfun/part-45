That doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s averse to breaking a rule or two.\nBut when her curiosity gets the better of her and she discovers Chase, a new teen locked in a cage in her guardianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s basement, and witnesses him turn into a wolf before her eyes, the horrific memories of her parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ murders return. Bryn becomes obsessed with getting her questions answered, and Chase is the only one who can provide the information she needs.\nBut in her drive to find the truth, will Bryn push too far beyond the constraints of the pack, forcing her to leave behind her friends, her family, and the identity that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shaped?\n\nTrial by Fire\nBryn is finally settling into her position as alpha of the Cedar Ridge PackÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â€or at least, her own version of what it means to be alpha when youÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â„¢re a human leading a band of werewolves. Then she finds a teenage boy bleeding on her front porch. Before collapsing, he tells her his name is Lucas, heÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â„¢s a Were, and BrynÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â„¢s protection is his only hope.\nBut Lucas isnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â„¢t part of BrynÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â„¢s pack, and she has no right to claim another alphaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â„¢s Were. With threatsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â€old and newÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â€looming, and danger closing in from all sides, Bryn will have to accept what her guardian Callum knew all along. To be alpha, she will have to give in to her own animal instincts and become less human. And, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â„¢s going to have to do it alone.\nBryn faces both the costs, and the rewards, of love and loyalty, in this thrilling sequel to Raised by Wolves.\n\nTaken by Storm\nBryn knows first-hand that being the alpha of a werewolf pack means making hard decisions, and that being human makes things a thousand times worse. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prepared to give up her humanity, but the wolf who promised to Change her is waiting Ã¢â‚¬â€œ though for what, Bryn doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know. Still human, she must take her place in the werewolf Senate, the precarious democracy that rules the North American packs. Standing side by side with werewolves who were ancient long before she was ever born is enough of a challenge, but Bryn soon learns that the Senate has been called to deal with a problem: the kind of problem that involves human bodies, a Rabid werewolf, and memories that Bryn, Chase, and the rest of their pack would rather forget. With bodies stacking up and political pressure closing in from all sides, Bryn and her pack are going to have to turn to old enemies and even older friends for help Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially when it starts to look like this time, the monster might be one of their own.\nUnabridged.\n\n------------------------------\nVisit us for this and more, book requests can also be made through the site:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:572dad69b4d9d665631707aea97aebebd2fa7de9","amp;dn":"Raised+by+Wolves+-+Jennifer+Lynn+Barnes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"572dad69b4d9d665631707aea97aebebd2fa7de9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,45,173,105,180,217,214,101,99,23,7,174,169,122,235,235,210,250,125,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
