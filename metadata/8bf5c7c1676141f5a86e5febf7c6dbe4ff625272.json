This is an updated version based on the original version called &quot;BRAVELY DEFAULT FLYING FAIRY&quot;.. The original version was released in Japan on 2012-10-11.\r\nThere is an actual sequel to this game though called &quot;BRAVELY SECOND END LAYER&quot;, which was released in Japan on 2015-04-23.\r\n\r\nThis is the japanese version of the game..\r\nHowever, it has options (in the &quot;Tactics&quot; menu) for other languages besides just japanese.. You can change back and forth between voice/text languages at any time during the game..\r\nFor voices, you can select from: Japanese, English. (Default is Japanese).\r\nFor text, you can select from: Japanese, English, French, Italian, German, Spanish. (Default is Japanese).\r\nThe original version (&quot;Flying Fairy&quot;) only had japanese voices and text..\r\n\r\nIf you have a saved game from the original version, supposedly it is compatible with this version too if you want to switch to playing on this version..\r\n\r\nHere are some modifications that this version has compared to the original &quot;Flying Fairy&quot; version:\r\n&gt;Automatic-battle system.\r\n&gt;Battle speed-up.\r\n&gt;Uses some mechanisms taken from the &quot;Bravely Second: End Layer&quot; game.\r\n&gt;Ability to change the encouter rate.\r\n&gt;Upgraded the town graphics.\r\n&gt;Improved character interface that now shows the statistics on the bottom screen.\r\n&gt;Improved battle interface that now shows the command input.\r\n&gt;Added some new voice/text languages.\r\n&gt;There are 3 save slots. (The original only had 1 save slot.)\r\n&gt;Added an Event Viewer.\r\n&gt;Revisions in the game events involving the Asterisk stones.\r\n\r\nThis is a single .3ds file inside of a .7z archive file..\r\n\r\nYou will need a gateway card (or some kind of CFW) to run it on your 3DS..\r\nAlso, make sure your gateway software is updated to the newest version..\r\nAt the time of this writing you need to have your sysnand on 9.2.0 or lower.. However if you have 10.3 or lower, there is a way that you can downgrade your sysnand to 9.2.0. (You will need to research it on a site like gbatemp.net to figure out how to do it).. But if you are on sysnand 10.4 or higher, it is not possible (at the time of this writing) to downgrade or hack your 3DS with out using a hardware-modified 3DS and a back-up of your NAND before it was updated in to an unhackable version range..\r\n\r\nThis game is 4.0 GB (when extracted), so you will probably have to split it using some thing similar to the &quot;gateway ROM splitter&quot; before you put it on your micro-SD card for the gateway card.. Only fat32 is officially supported by gateway (exfat causes problems), and of course fat32 doesn't support files bigger than 4GB (I think this game is just slightly over the limit)..\r\n\r\nI have confirmed it to work at least with this set up:\r\nnew-3DS\r\nsysnand: 9.2.0\r\nemunand: 10.4.0\r\ngateway launcher software version: 3.7.1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bf5c7c1676141f5a86e5febf7c6dbe4ff625272","amp;dn":"%5B3DS%5D+Bravely+Default%3A+For+the+Sequel+%5BJPN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bf5c7c1676141f5a86e5febf7c6dbe4ff625272","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,245,199,193,103,97,65,245,168,110,95,235,247,198,219,228,255,98,82,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
