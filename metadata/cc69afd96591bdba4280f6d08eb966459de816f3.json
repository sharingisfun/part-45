It's winter, 1974, and Ed Dunford's the crime correspondent of the &quot;Evening Post&quot;. He didn't know that this Christmas was going to be a season in hell. A dead little girl with a swan's wings stitched to her back.  \n\nSecond in the &quot;Red Riding Quartet&quot;, this tale is set in Jubilee year. Its heroes, the half-decent copper Bof Fraser and the burnt-out hack Jack Whitehead are the only two who suspect that there is more than one killer at large among the Chapeltown whores. \n\nThird in the &quot;Red Riding Quartet&quot;, this tale is set in 1980, when the Yorkshire Ripper murders his 13th victim. Assistant Chief Constable Hunter is drawn into a world of corruption and sleaze. When his house is burned down and his wife threatened, his quest becomes personal.\n\n\nThe intertwining storylines see the &quot;Red Riding Quartet's&quot; central themes of corruption and the perversion of justice come to a head as BJ the rent boy, lawyer Big John Piggott, and cop Maurice Oldfield, find themselves on a collision course that can only end in terrible vengeance.
