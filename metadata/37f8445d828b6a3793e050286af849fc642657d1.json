The approach is as powerful as ever, but the arrival of a new global investment terrainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“with its differing politico-economic systems, rising markets, and increasing collisionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“is creating both historic challenges and opportunities for value investors. Now, Jeffrey Towson shows how to uncover unprecedented value opportunities in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s colliding, chaotic, and wildly mispriced new global marketplace.\nDrawing on extensive experience investing and deal-making on the ground around the world, Towson introduces a new value playbook for global investing. He shows how value investors, private equity firms, family offices, institutional investors, and others can use a value-added approach to confidently and comfortably extend their current investment strategies to global opportunities. The result is a practical investment playbook for a global age, identifying todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best opportunities, and preparing you for massive market shifts that are just beginning to emerge.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37f8445d828b6a3793e050286af849fc642657d1","amp;dn":"Jeffrey+Towson+-+What+Would+Ben+Graham+Do+Now%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37f8445d828b6a3793e050286af849fc642657d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,248,68,93,130,139,106,55,147,224,80,40,106,248,73,252,100,38,87,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
