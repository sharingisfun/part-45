First aired and captured in H264 AVCHD at 8,000 kbps from the 1920 x 1080i HD resolution source on 01/05/2013 on the Cartoon Network HD channel on DirecTv HDTV Digital Satellite. Then converted to 1080p with Handbrake version 0.9.8. The Framerate is 29.970 with an average Video Bitrate of 6,500 kbps in a High Quality 882 MB 1080p H264 AVCHD MKV release with Dual Audio that is 48khz 448 kbps Dolby Digital 5.1 channel surround audio and 320 kbps AAC 2 channel stereo audio the total show runtime is 22 Minutes and 26 seconds long.\n\nThis is my 193rd official H264 AVCHD release. Enjoy the Star Wars The Clone Wars show Star Wars fans. \n\nMy 1080p releases are in MKV format with Dual Audio tracks Audio #1 is Dolby Digital 5.1 channel surround audio and Audio #2 is AAC 2 channel stereo audio so that they are playable with Media Player Classic, Windows Media Player, and any other devices capable of playing 1080p HD MKV video files.\n\nTo ensure that you can get proper MKV playback after the mkv conversion be sure you have installed the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and configure it properly for .mkv playback. If you do not have it you can get it here below: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm&lt;/a&gt; \n\nOnce installed you can playback the .mkv file with the following players:\n\nMedia Player Classic or Windows Media Player. \n\nVLC player doesn't play the MKV video only the audio for some unknown reason, so use the above players or you can burn the .mkv video file to a DVD -R disc or load it onto a USB flash drive and play it back on any BluRay player that is MKV compatible and has a USB port like my Panasonic DMP BD75 BluRay player and LG BP-620 3D BluRay player does.\n\nTo get VLC player to play MKV files created from my mp4 files using MkvMerge:\n\nYou can speed up the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC playback by disabling loop filter for H.264 decoding. To do this go to Tools -&gt; Preferences and Input / Codecs and in the drop-down box for Skip H.264 in-loop deblocking filter change it to All. Remember to press Save to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.\n\nAlso if you have a multicore CPU (or one with Intel Hyper-Threading), you can lower the FFMPEG thread count. To do this go to Tools -&gt; Preferences (Show settings: All), then Input / Codecs -&gt; Video codecs -&gt; FFmpeg, then locate Threads, and set it to 4 (or to 2, or to 1). (SCSA420 says put a check into the Hardware decoding box) Remember to press Save to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.\n \nEnjoy the show Star Wars The Clone Wars fans and thanks for downloading my Star Wars The Clone Wars HDTV S05E12 1080p AVCHD-SC-SDH release.\n\nUploaded by SCSA420 on ThePirateBay.se and KickAss Torrents\n\n\nStoneCold420 \nSmackDownHotel\nJanuary 5, 2013\n\n\nFor more information on Star Wars The Clone Wars HDTV series visit:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://theclonewars.cartoonnetwork.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://theclonewars.cartoonnetwork.com&lt;/a&gt;  \nand   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.starwars.com/explore/the-clone-wars&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.starwars.com/explore/the-clone-wars&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nFor all things Star Wars related go here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.starwars.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.starwars.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor even more Star Wars The Clone Wars fun go here: &lt;a href=&quot; https://www.clonewarsadventures.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://www.clonewarsadventures.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor SC-SDH releases from 2012-03-29 onward please go here:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SCSA420&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SCSA420&lt;/a&gt; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10aab2c5b72abbb6f34c43ad54fc58212f10bb9b","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+The+Clone+Wars+HDTV+S05E12+1080p+AVCHD-SC-SDH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10aab2c5b72abbb6f34c43ad54fc58212f10bb9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,170,178,197,183,42,187,182,243,76,67,173,84,252,88,33,47,16,187,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
