Lights Out\n2. Laugh It Off\n3. Deep Space\n4. 192 Days\n5. One Last Song\n\nDespite the fact that the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name hints of a planet that existed a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, Eisley are much more down to earth; a group of five Texans and essentially a family business, the members are certainly not alien to each other. And coming straight off of their critically acclaimed album, &quot;The Valley,&quot; their latest offering has a lot to live up to.\n\nIn fact jumping straight in to the Mars Volta-esque quirkiness of &quot;Lights Out&quot; conventions are generally tossed out of the window as Eisley succeed in crafting a piece of music thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interesting to listen to from start to finish, not afraid to push boundaries and certainly not below showing off their potential.\n\nAnd as if there was any question about whether this band has talent the fantastic waltz of vocalization that dances spectacularly around the mellow synthesizer that falls amongst the delicate vocals of the brilliant &quot;Laugh It Off,&quot; which is finished off perfectly by a slew of drum fills that not many would think to attempt in a largely acoustic song, but which work in a way which is again, very interesting to listen to.\n\nAnd to then move into the acoustic lullaby of the sweet as sugar &quot;192 Days,&quot; which delights with its jovial lyrics and hopeful tone and message, a song that is really quite difficult not to enjoy, and one that takes a turn for the twisted in the bridge, a fact that adds a much appreciated fourth dimension to this already enjoyable track.\n\nAn EP that is delightful to all of the senses if you have good taste and one that never ceases to please from start to finish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6cdebb1419dbd1a4364a81c8adf8605d79224fe","amp;dn":"Eisley+-+Deep+Space+%5B2012%5D%5BFLAC%5D+%5BEP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6cdebb1419dbd1a4364a81c8adf8605d79224fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,205,235,177,65,157,189,26,67,100,168,28,138,223,134,5,215,146,36,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
