Separate 32-bit and 64-bit versions are available.\r\n\r\n*******************************\r\nAdditional standalone configuration utility\r\n\r\nThe overall program display font face &amp; size can be adjusted via a special program setting. A standalone configuration utility - FSConfig - is available to make it easier to make adjust the setting.\r\n\r\nFSConfig is used to more easily specify several program settings used by the programs:\r\n- Application font face &amp; size: The font face and size used by the program main window.\r\n- Zip Masks: File name suffix treated by the program as a zip or archive file. The default setting is *.zip;*.jar;*.xlsx;*.docx;*.pptx\r\n- Prompt to 'Fix Line Endings': By default the internal context viewer prompts to fix the line endings in a file if the file contains mixed line boundaries, e.g., some lines are 'Unix' and others are 'PC' format. \r\n\r\nFSConfig runs on Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8, 32 &amp; 64-bit editions.\r\n*****************************\r\n\r\n************\r\nTorrent includes\r\n************\r\n\r\n- Funduc Replace Studio Pro 7.17 x86/x64 installers RETAIL VERSIONS\r\n- Funduc Replace Studio Pro 7.17 x86 retail portable (works fine on x64 machines and includes standalone configuration utility FSConfig)\r\n\r\nHomepage: http://www.funduc.com/replace_studio_pro.htm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b57985957360ef04558dc6437f67d7b9d40bac28","amp;dn":"Funduc+Replace+Studio+Pro+7.17+Retail+%28Local+install+%2B+Portable%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b57985957360ef04558dc6437f67d7b9d40bac28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,121,133,149,115,96,239,4,85,141,198,67,127,103,215,185,212,11,172,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
