Williams - Kommander of Kaos 1986 320ak\r\n\r\nWendy Orlean Williams (May 28, 1949 â€“ April 6, 1998), better known as Wendy O. Williams, was an American singer, songwriter and actress. Born in Webster, New York, she first came to prominence as the lead singer of the punk rock band Plasmatics. Her infamous stage theatrics included blowing up equipment, near nudity and chain-sawing guitars. After she left home at the age of 16, Williams hitchhiked her way to Colorado, earning money by crocheting string bikinis. She later traveled to Florida and Europe landing various jobs such as lifeguard, stripper and server at Dunkin' Donuts. When she returned to California in 1978, she began performing in live sex shows and later appeared in the adult film, Candy Goes to Hollywood (1979). That same year, she was approached by the manager Rod Swenson, who recruited her to join his newly formed punk rock band, Plasmatics. The band shortly became known on the New York City underground scene, performing at clubs such as CBGB.\r\n\r\nAfter releasing three albums with Plasmatics, Williams embarked on a solo career and in 1984 released her debut album, WOW. She followed with the albums Kommander of Kaos (1986) and Deffest! and Baddest! (1988), before she retired from the music industry. Williams made her screen debut in Tom DeSimone's film Reform School Girls (1986), for which she recorded the title song. \r\n\r\nShe also appeared in the 1989 comedy Pucker Up and Bark Like a Dog, and television series The New Adventures of Beans Baxter and MacGyver. On April 6, 1998, Williams committed suicide near her home in Storrs, Connecticut.\r\n\r\nDubbed &quot;The Queen of Shock Rock,&quot; Williams was widely considered the most controversial and radical female singer of her day. She often sported a Mohawk haircut. In 1985, she was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Female Rock Vocal Performance category during the height of her popularity as a solo artist.\r\n\r\nYear:\t1986\r\n\r\nStyle:\tHeavy Metal\r\n\r\nAdditional: Speed Metal, Hard Rock and Punk\r\n\r\nShe was all over the place.\r\nHer and Lemmy were also friends\r\nAnd she inspired the The Butcher Babies\r\n\r\nCountry:\tUSA\r\nFormat:\t320 mp3\r\n\r\nSize:\t79.22 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t01/05/2016 \r\n\r\nFiles:\t10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\n\r\nLength:0:34:24\r\n\r\nTracks:\r\n\r\n01 - Hoy Hey (Live to Rock) (03:46)\r\n02 - Pedal to the Metal (03:29)\r\n03 - Goin' Wild (04:13)\r\n04 - Ain't None of Your Business (live) (05:36)\r\n05 - Party (03:37)\r\n06 - Jailbait (MotÃ¶rhead cover) (03:25)\r\n07 - Bad Girl (03:36)\r\n08 - Fight for the Right (03:11)\r\n09 - Fuck That Booty (Work That Muscle) (03:31)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d89099da522496d3548de82845430e148bcee771","amp;dn":"Wendy+O.+Williams+-+Kommander+of+Kaos+1986+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d89099da522496d3548de82845430e148bcee771","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,144,153,218,82,36,150,211,84,141,232,40,69,67,14,20,139,206,231,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
