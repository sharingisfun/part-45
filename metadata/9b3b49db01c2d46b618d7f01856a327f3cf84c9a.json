Frequently, the budget constraints are all too obvious, but here is a sterling example of how a concert DVD should be done. At two hours and fifteen minutes, PFM deliver the goods in a no frills performance in front of an appreciative audience of adoring fans. Recorded at the Club Citta in Kawasaki Japan, this group of old guys is absolutely on fire. Mainstays Franco Mussida on guitar, Flavio Premoli on keyboards, Patrick Djivas on bass and crazy man Franz Di Cioccio on drums and vocals are ably assisted by Lucio Fabbri on violin and keyboards. Rounding out the lineup is Piero Monterisi on drums while Di Cioccio takes center stage to sing. I confess that I have only heard Serendipity from the more recent PFM catalog and I didn't know what to expect in terms of a setlist or indeed how the band would actually sound. I was more than pleasantly surprised to discover that most of the concert is comprised of material from their classic early seventies albums. From the unmistakable opening notes of &quot;La Carozza di Hans&quot; to the final encore of &quot;La Luna Nuova&quot;, it is difficult to pull the DVD out of the player. While the band provide faithful renditions of classics like &quot;River of Life&quot;, &quot;Out of the Roundabout&quot; and a gorgeous &quot;Impressioni di Settembre&quot;, they love to jam as well. In fact the highlight of the concert is the closing &quot;Tokyo Violin Jam&quot;, featuring a slice of Rossini's &quot;William Tell Overture&quot;, just like in the old days!\n\n\n\nDVD INFO\n\nSize: 7.93 Gb ( 8 314 118 KBytes ) - DVD-9\nEnabled regions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\nPlay Length: 02:12:58\nVideo: NTCS 4:3 (720x480) VBR\nAudio: Italiano (Dolby AC3, 6 ch), (Dolby AC3, 2 ch)\nMenu Video:\nNTCS 4:3 (720x480) VBR\nMenu Audio:\nNot specified (Dolby AC3, 2 ch)\nMenu Japanese Language Unit :\nRoot Menu","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b3b49db01c2d46b618d7f01856a327f3cf84c9a","amp;dn":"PFM+-+Premiata+Forneria+Marconi+%3A+Live+In+Japan+%282002%29+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b3b49db01c2d46b618d7f01856a327f3cf84c9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,59,73,219,1,194,212,107,97,141,127,1,133,106,50,127,60,248,76,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
