While this wanders a bit from the mission statement of this collection, the Kerrigan translations are still light-years ahead of those by Hurley, and I agree with those who'd rather I include them than allow them to gather dust. \n\nAs before, these e-texts are offered in DRM-free EPUB &amp; MOBI format with an active Table of Contents, and include works from:\n\n\nThe Aleph &amp; Other Stories\nA History of Infamy\nThe Book of Sand\nIn Praise of Darkness\nDoctor Brodie's Report\nThe Garden of Branching Paths\nLabyrinths\nThe Book of Imaginary Beings\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d47c7440457a6d044083799c0592b9ce82b369e","amp;dn":"Short+Stories+of+Jorge+Luis+Borges+-+The+Giovanni+Translations+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d47c7440457a6d044083799c0592b9ce82b369e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,71,199,68,4,87,166,208,68,8,55,153,192,89,43,156,232,43,54,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
