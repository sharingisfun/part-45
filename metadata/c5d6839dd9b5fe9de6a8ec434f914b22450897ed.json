Rome. At the heights of vicious attacks by the Red Brigade terrorists, journalist David Raybourne (Andrew McCarthy) returns to the turbulent world of Italian politics he had known as a student to work on an American newspaper. He goes back to his old apartment, rekindles his affair with the married Stephane and meets Alison King (Sharon Stone), a photographer famous for her pictures of the aftermath of violence. \n\nBut David Raybourne has a secret - he is researching and writing a book about the much-feared terrorist organisation the Red Brigade. As a result of his secrecy and deception, he unknowingly puts his own and many other lives at risk and soon discovers that even ordinary people have a dangerous side when they are faced with a struggle for personal survival.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5d6839dd9b5fe9de6a8ec434f914b22450897ed","amp;dn":"Year+of+the+Gun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5d6839dd9b5fe9de6a8ec434f914b22450897ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,214,131,157,217,181,254,157,230,168,236,67,79,145,75,34,69,8,151,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
