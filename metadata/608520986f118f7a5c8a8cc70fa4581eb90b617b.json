You want them to be impressed, amazed, thrilled. You need Flash animations that will light the spark in your visitors eyes, and encourage them to explore amazing things that you have to offer.\n\nAnd yes, you can make that cool Flash animations by yourself, for free! Using Vectorian Giotto, a completely free Flash animation software, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have a chance to make what you want, and how you want it! You just have to get through few tutorials, and there you go, you can start animating. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s free for both personal and commercial use, so there are no boundaries to your creativity!\n\nIts absolutely free, as in $0.00! There is NO catch ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ download and start using it NOW.\n\nWe created Giotto for designers, not coders\nGiotto is the free Flash animation package made for you to design, not to code. With Giotto you can relax and focus your imagination on creative concepts, integrating stunning graphics and music into masterpieces of design.\n\nThe latest versions of AdobeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® FlashÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® are moving away from designers. They are becoming more and more oriented towards coders. With the introduction of ActionScript 3, creating a simple action such as button click now requires ten times more coding than before.\n\nGiotto has full support for ActionScript 2, but we made built-in effect generators that will help you create outstanding effects without any scripting at all. This software is made for you, designers.\n\nVector drawing, animations, sounds, filtersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nCreate complex vector illustrations in Giotto, anything from simple shapes to custom ones like polygon, star, or rounded rectangle. Transform vector objects in any imaginable way. Use bitmap filters like blur, drop shadow, glow, and all blend modes.\n\nOrganize all objects in the Library, create symbols like Movie Clips and Buttons for multiple use. Add text fields, with font kerning and paragraph alignment.\n\nAnimate objects with motion tweens and shape tweens. Add sound to movies and create advanced interactivity.\n\nPowerful animated effects without any scripting at all\nGiotto comes packed with more than 50 great effects that can be applied to both shapes and text. All effects are fully and easily customizable through the effect editor, and the results are immediately visible on the screen for you to play and explore.\n\nThere are more than 100 effect presets, to show the new user the different ways the effects can be adjusted.\n\nThese effects are based on ActionScript, but you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need to know the code behind them. Creating a perfect banner has never been easier!\n\nColor palette editor that you can actually use\nOne of the main advantages of Giotto is its built-in editor for color palettes. Most color palette editors out there are quite useless, but we made GiottoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very applicable in real life.\n\nThe Color palette editor uses special algorithms based on human perception of colors, rather then traditional mathematical models which produce poor results.\n\nOnce you select the base color of your project, you would have countless options to create palettes using many various matching algorithms. This makes the start of your new project quite easy!\n\nUser interface very similar to AdobeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® FlashÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®\nSwitching from one animation software to another can be hard. We hate learning to use completely new software as much as you do. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why we created GiottoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s user interface very similar to AdobeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® FlashÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® and simplified it further in order to enable designers to achieve results easier and faster.\n\nAlthough itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s freeware, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no lacking of major features, and everything is where you think it should be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ tools, context menus, object propertiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ so you will have the sense of familiarity and ease of use from the very first moment you open it.\n\nWe have added some new elements like natural color palette editor, effects generator, and other tools that create stunning effects without ever touching the ActionScript.\n\nHome Page - http://vectorian.com/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:608520986f118f7a5c8a8cc70fa4581eb90b617b","amp;dn":"Vectorian+Giotto+3.0.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"608520986f118f7a5c8a8cc70fa4581eb90b617b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,133,32,152,111,17,143,122,92,138,140,199,15,164,88,30,185,11,97,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
