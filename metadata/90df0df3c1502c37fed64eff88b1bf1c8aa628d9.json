This book explains how teachers, through the elementary school football association, introduced boys to organised football as an out-of-school activity. The influence and significance of this work, insofar as it relates to the elementary school curriculum and the growth of professional and amateur football are explored in detail, including:\n* How ideological commitments and contemporary concerns for the physical welfare of children in cities may have led teachers to promote schoolboy football when it was not permitted during school hours.\n* The extent to which out of school organised football may have led to outdoor games being accepted as part of the school curriculum\n* How elementary school football in London in the late nineteenth century influenced the development of the amateur game\nThis is a fascinating account of the origins of schoolboy football and the factors that have influenced its development and the consequences and benefits that have followed not only for school football but for sport in schools and communities as a whole.\n\n\n\nThe Football Manager: A History\n\nFootball managers are at the center of today's commercially-driven football world, scrutinized, celebrated and under pressure as never before. This book is the first in-depth history of the role of the manager in British football, tracing a path from Victorian-era amateurism to the highly paid motivational specialists and media personalities of the twenty-first century.\n\nUsing original source materials, the book traces the changing character and function of the football manager, covering:\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· the origins of football management - club secretaries and early pioneers\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· the impact of post-war social change - the advent of the football business\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· television and the new commercialism\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· contemporary football - specialization and the influence of foreign managers and management practices\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· the future of football management\n\nThe Football Manager examines the influence of Britain's traditionally pragmatic and hierarchical business management culture onBritish football, and in doing so provides a new and broader perspective on a unique management role and a unique way of life.\n\nFor those interested in the history of football and for those interested in management more generally, this book is a valuable new resource.\n\n\n\nThe Work of Professional Football: A Labour of Love?\n\nThe Work of Professional Football: A Labour of Love? presents unique long-term studies and provides rare insights into to the precarious careers and ordinary working culture of professional soccer footballers. Away from the celebrity-obsessed media gaze, the work of a professional footballer is infrequently glamorous and for most players a career in football is insecure and short-lived.\n\nAs a former professional soccer player turned academic, Martin Roderick's familiarity with the world of football is foundational to this privileged research into a world that is typically both 'closed' to the public gaze and ignored by media reportage and academic research which prefers to focus on a small, unrepresentative group of elite players. Key themes explored within the text include:\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The culture of work in professional soccer football\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The changing identity, orientation and expectations of players during their career\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The fragile and uncertain nature of careers inprofessional sport\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The performance and drama of a career under public scrutiny\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The role of relationships with managers, owners, support staff and partners\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The insecurities inherent in a football career such as injury, aging, performance and transfer\n\nThe text deals with a wide range of issues for sports students and academics, particularly those with a focus on the sociology of sport but also including sport development, sport management and coaching studies. The text will be of interest to researchers in sport studies, careers, industrial relations and the sociology of work.\n\n\n\nFootball in the New Media Age\n\nFootball/soccer in the new media age can often appear ubiquitous, dominating much of the mainstream news and current affairs agenda. The vast amounts of money paid to elite soccer players and the inability of young men to cope with this when combined with their media-fuelled celebrity status have frequently made headlines. However at the core of this process is the battle to control a game which has exploited its position as a key &quot;content provider&quot; for new media developments over the last decade.\n\nBased on extensive interviews with key players in the media and soccer industries, Football in the New Media Age analyzes the impact of media change on the soccer industry. It examines the finances of the game, the importance of rights and rights management in the industry and attempts by clubs themselves to develop their own media capacity. It also explores the key role played by soccer supporters. At the core of the book is an examination of the battle for control of the game as media, business and fans all seek to redefine the sport in the twenty first century.\n\n\n\nScience and Football V: The Proceedings of the Fifth World Congress on Sports Science and Football\nScience and Football VI: The Proceedings of the Sixth World Congress on Sports Science and Football\n\nScience and Football V and VI presents the edited papers from the Fifth and Sixth World Congress on Science and Football that took place in Portugal in April 2003 and Turkey in January 2007.
