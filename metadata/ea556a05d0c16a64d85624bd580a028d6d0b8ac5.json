He vividly recalls those transformative years working under the legendary Will Eisner, and later, after he was drafted into the army, his evolution from Ã¢â‚¬Å“smart-ass kid into an enraged satirist.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Backing into Forward also traces Feiffer's love life, from a doomed hitchhiking trip to reclaim his high-school sweetheart to losing his virginity in Greenwich Village, and his road to marriage and fatherhood.\n\n At the center of this journey is Feiffer's prolific creativity. In dazzling detail, he recounts the birth of his subversive graphic novella Munro, his entrÃƒÂ©e into New York's literary salons, collaborations with film greats Mike Nichols, Robert Altman, and Jack Nicholson, and other major turning points. Brimming with wry punch lines, slices of Americana, and pithy social commentary, Backing into Forward charts Feiffer's rise as an unlikely and incisive provocateur during the conformist fifties and the Vietnam and Civil Rights sixties and seventies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea556a05d0c16a64d85624bd580a028d6d0b8ac5","amp;dn":"Jules+Feiffer+-+Backing+Into+Forward-+A+Memoir+%28retail%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea556a05d0c16a64d85624bd580a028d6d0b8ac5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,85,106,5,208,193,106,100,216,86,36,189,88,10,2,141,109,11,138,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
