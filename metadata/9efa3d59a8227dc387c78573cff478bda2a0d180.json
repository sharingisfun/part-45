In the 1980s BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn got into TV shows like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶jesmassakernÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKryzzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The movie &quot;Strul&quot; from 1988 was a huge hit, and he was again noticed internationally when &quot;Hooked on a feeling&quot; was featured in Quentin Tarantino's &quot;Reservoir dogs&quot;.\n\nIn later years he has returned to music. He is born in 1947 in Vansbro, Sweden.\n\n\nTrack list:\n\n01 Pinewood rally \n02 Never my love \n03 (I washed my hands in) Muddy water \n04 Lonely sunday afternoon \n05 Hooked on a feeling \n06 Half breed \n07 Destiny \n08 Something's burning \n09 Working in the coalmine \n10 Silly Milly \n11 Always something there to remind me \n12 A song for you\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9efa3d59a8227dc387c78573cff478bda2a0d180","amp;dn":"Bj%C3%83%C2%B6rn+Skifs+%26+Bl%C3%83%C2%A5blus+-+Pinewood+rally+LP+%281973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9efa3d59a8227dc387c78573cff478bda2a0d180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,250,61,89,168,34,125,195,135,199,133,115,207,244,120,189,162,160,209,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
