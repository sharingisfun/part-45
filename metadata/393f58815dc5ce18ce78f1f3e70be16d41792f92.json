For every spectacular discovery throughout history, there have been hundreds of devastating epidemics; for every benevolent despot, a thousand like Vlad the Impaler; for every cup half-full, a larger cup half-empty. This enthralling, enlightening, and devilishly entertaining chronicle of disasters and dastardly deeds brings to light the darkest events in history and the most abysmal calamities to strike the planet . . . so far.\n\n88 BC: Mithridates VI Eupator provides an early example of genocide by massacring 100,000 Romans.\n\n1347: Saint Vitus' Dance Epidemic shimmies across Europe like a deadly disco fever, leaving its victims twitching, uncontrollably leaping, and foaming at the mouth.\n\n1888: Jack the Ripper stalks through the dark alleys of Whitechapel, England, turning the world's oldest profession into the world's most dangerous one.\n\n1939: A Swiss chemist wins a Nobel Prize for developing DDTÃ¢â‚¬â€and the environment gets another nail in the coffin.\n\n2005: Hurricane Katrina devastates the Gulf Coast.
