One such artist was Jim Croce, a songwriter with a knack for both upbeat, catchy singles and empathetic, melancholy ballads. Though Croce only recorded a few studio albums before an untimely plane crash, he continues to be remembered posthumously. Croce appealed to fans as a common man, and it was not a gimmick -- he was a father and husband who went through a series of blue-collar jobs. And whether he used dry wit, gentle emotions, or sorrow, Croce sang with a rare form of honesty and power. Few artists have ever been able to pull off such down-to-earth storytelling as convincingly as he was. \n\n\n\nFamed for -- and ultimately defined by -- his perennial 'American Pie', singer/songwriter Don McLean was born October 2, 1945, in New Rochelle, NY. After getting his start in the folk clubs of New York City during the mid-'60s, McLean struggled for a number of years, building a small following through his work with Pete Seeger on the Clearwater, a sloop that sailed up and down the eastern seaboard to promote environmental causes.\n\nStill, McLean was primarily singing in elementary schools and the like when in 1970 he wrote a musical tribute to painter Vincent Van Gogh; the project was roundly rejected by a number of labels, although MediaArts did offer him a contract to record a number of his other songs under the title Tapestry. The album fared poorly, but Perry Como earned a hit with a cover of the track 'And I Love Her So,' prompting United Artists to pick up McLean's contract. He returned in 1971 with American Pie; the title track, an elegiac eight-and-a-half-minute folk-pop epic inspired by the tragic death of Buddy Holly, became a number one hit, and the LP soon reached the top of the charts as well. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\n\n\n01.American Pie, Pt. 1 - Don McLean\n02.I Got A Name - Jim Croce\n03.Castles In The Air - Don McLean\n04.You Don't Mess Around With Jim - Jim Croce\n05.Everyday - Don McLean\n06.Operator (That's Not The Way It Feels) - Jim Croce\n07.Vincent - Don McLean\n08.Time In A Bottle - Jim Croce\n09.Dreidel - Don McLean\n10.Workin' At The Car Wash Blues - Jim Croce\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef20f1df3fd8b6e0b9c136b7291b7ed1d38a1da5","amp;dn":"Jim+Croce+And+Don+McLean+-+Hits+%281995%29++%5BCD+Rip%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef20f1df3fd8b6e0b9c136b7291b7ed1d38a1da5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,32,241,223,63,216,182,224,185,193,54,183,41,27,126,209,211,138,29,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
