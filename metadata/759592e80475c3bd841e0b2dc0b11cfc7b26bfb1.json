She has a list of secret wishes she wants to come true. When the big day finally arrives, she excitedly adds her 16th and final wish to the secret wish list she's been keeping - a photo of Logan (Keenan Tracy), her crush. Then begins the first of many unusual occurrences, each including visits from a peculiar woman, Celeste (Anna Mae Routledge). She first appears as an exterminator when the Jensen's house gets overrun by wasps from a nest in their attic that has been building up for 16 years. The Jensen family are now unable to go back into their house until the wasps are exterminated, however, Celeste manages to extract Abby's wish list from the house. Abby's best friend, Jay Kepler (Jean-Luc Bilodeau), appears and offers Abby a jacket to wear over her pajamas, as she is unable to go back into her house to change. When Abby reaches into Jay's jacket pocket, she finds a birthday present for her from Jay. It is a necklace with a half of a heart saying &quot;BFF&quot;. Jay has the other half which he uses as a charm on his key ring. As Jay and Abby go to their bus stop, a delivery truck pulls up, and Celeste comes out, dressed as a mail woman and gives a package to Abby. When Abby opens it, she discovers 16 candles and a matchbox.\n\nscreenz\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/14414807868471612150.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/14414807868471612150.png&lt;/a&gt;\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/61745184627399846310.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/61745184627399846310.png&lt;/a&gt;\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/84192870673173474328.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/84192870673173474328.png&lt;/a&gt;\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/49220967697100706412.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/49220967697100706412.png&lt;/a&gt;\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/62688600795337203852.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/62688600795337203852.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/27728281618128021793.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/27728281618128021793.png&lt;/a&gt;\n        \nOVER ALL IMAGE\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/79243710983757413261.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/79243710983757413261.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\ndo join my fan page if u have any requests and if u like my uploads\n\nFace book Fanpage and Movie request page\n \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://on(space).fb.me/Deffjam555&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://on(space).fb.me/Deffjam555&lt;/a&gt;\n\nremove &quot;(space)&quot; from above and paste it @ address bar \t\t\nor search &quot;Deffjam555 Torrents&quot; @ facebook","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:759592e80475c3bd841e0b2dc0b11cfc7b26bfb1","amp;dn":"16.Wishes.2010.BRRip.x264-%7Bdeff%7D%28PURE+RG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"759592e80475c3bd841e0b2dc0b11cfc7b26bfb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,149,146,232,4,117,195,189,132,30,11,45,192,177,28,252,123,38,191,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
