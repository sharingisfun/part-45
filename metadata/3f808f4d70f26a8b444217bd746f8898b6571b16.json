But there was one determined to see this fledgling faith exterminated.  His name was Saul, and he became the greatest persecutor of the early church.  \r\n\r\nBut within a matter of a few years, the Christian's fiercest opponent became its most effective advocate.  Struck down by a powerful conversion experience on the road to Damascus, Saul---his name changed to Paul---went on to become the greatest missionary in the history of Christianity.  He wrote more of the New Testament books than any other.  In this impressive drama starring Garry Cooper we follow Saul the angry zealot to Paul the emissary of Christ who will pay any price to bring his message to the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f808f4d70f26a8b444217bd746f8898b6571b16","amp;dn":"The+Bible+Series+2+-+Paul+the+Emissary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f808f4d70f26a8b444217bd746f8898b6571b16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,128,143,77,112,242,106,139,68,66,23,189,116,111,136,152,182,87,27,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
