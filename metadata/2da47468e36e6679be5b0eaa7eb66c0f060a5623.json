Next came &quot;Science Fair&quot;, and it was even better - Emm stripped down and completely honest. I became a fan. Then came her &quot;Asian Blue&quot; album. Boy, was I disappointed. I think she went to LA and worked with some producer and in my opinion, that was a big mistake - maybe it was just the wrong guy. I stopped following her career for awhile, and then I saw this , and thought I'd give it a shot. Emm is back - in a BIG WAY. This is like Public and Science Fair all rolled into one, beautiful melodies, great songwriting, and it's produced just right. Not over done, and not stripped down. It lets Emm's voice and her songs shine, and it was so good to hear her writing and recording like this again. If you like singer/songwriters with TALENT, get this album, it's amazing.....\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2da47468e36e6679be5b0eaa7eb66c0f060a5623","amp;dn":"Emm+Gryner+-+The+Summer+of+High+Hopes+%5B2006%5D+%5BEAC.Log%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2da47468e36e6679be5b0eaa7eb66c0f060a5623","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,164,116,104,227,110,102,121,190,91,14,170,126,182,108,15,6,10,86,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
