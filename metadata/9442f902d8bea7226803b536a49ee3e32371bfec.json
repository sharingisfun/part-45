I've enjoyed a noisy CDR for years, forgetting the exact source format\n\nwhich I suspect was the lowly cassette tape.  Lately I purchased a legit CD\n\nbecause of all those listens and even though the CD too is noisy....the music\n\nI find wonderful. It sets a pensive, somewhat mournful mood.\n\n\nJohn Lewis is famous for his work with Modern Jazz Quartet.....his playing is\n\nnearly always concise, tasteful, and lacking superfluous notes.  Svend Asmussen's\n\nsoulful violin is the perfect complement for Lewis.  He adds double stops in all \n\nthe right places.
