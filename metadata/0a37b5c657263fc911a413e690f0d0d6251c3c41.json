The original version of &quot;HIStory&quot; was released as a track on Jackson's 1995 studio album HIStory, but was never released as a single. &quot;Ghosts&quot; was a brand new recording.\n\n&quot;HIStory&quot; was composed by Michael Jackson, James Harris III and Terry Lewis before it was remixed by Tony Moran in 1997. Like the original version, it contained many historic audio clips and samples. &quot;Ghosts&quot; was written, composed and produced by Jackson and Teddy Riley in 1997. Commentators made observations about the paranoid lyrics, a common theme in Jackson's work.\n\nThe double A-side was promoted with a music video for each song. &quot;HIStory&quot; was set in a nightclub, in a futuristic era, and recalled Jackson's filmography. &quot;Ghosts&quot; was a five minute clip taken from the much longer film of the same name. The song would become a top five hit in the UK, but did not chart as highly elsewhere.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Ghosts&quot; was a five minute clip taken from a film entitled Ghosts. Jackson unveiled the film at the Cannes Film Festival, as part of the album promotion. It was released theatrically in the US in October 1996, as for the UK, it debuted at the Odeon Leicester Square in May 1997. The UK event attracted fans, media and business organizations. It was released on cassette in most parts of the world. The film was written by Jackson and Stephen King and directed by Stan Winston. The story was based loosely on the events and isolation Jackson felt after he was accused of child sexual abuse in 1993. In the plot, the MaestroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½played by JacksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is nearly chased out of his town by the residents and the mayorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who deliberately looks very similar to Tom Sneddon, a prosecutor who led the child sexual abuse investigation against Jackson several years previouslyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½because they believe him to be a &quot;freak&quot;. The film had similar imagery and themes to that of Thriller. It features many special effects and dance moves choreographed to original music, which Jackson himself authored. The film includes several songs and music videos from the albums HIStory and Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix. The video for Ghosts is over thirty-eight minutes long and holds the Guinness World Record as the world's longest music video. It won the Bob Fosse Award for Best Choreography in a Music Video.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a37b5c657263fc911a413e690f0d0d6251c3c41","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+-+Ghosts+%28Short+Version%29++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a37b5c657263fc911a413e690f0d0d6251c3c41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,55,181,198,87,38,63,201,17,164,19,230,144,240,208,214,37,28,60,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
