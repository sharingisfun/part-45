For 2,500 years, it has been a blazing signal and around this obsession entire industries have developed, influential trends set. From Greek prostitutes mimicking the golden-haired Aphrodite, to the Californian beach babe; from pigeon-dung and saffron dyes to L'OrealÃ¢â‚¬â€because you're worth itÃ¢â‚¬â€we see the lengths to which women will go to become blonde. The power and duality of the blonde as either erotic symbol or saintly virgin waxes and wanes but never disappears. Weaving a story rich in anecdote, history and high intrigue, Joanna Pitman effortlessly combines the wealth of her knowledge with a sharp and clear-sighted view of the power of the blonde throughout the ages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44e6e1144ad4f55126d42059795f264a11708f13","amp;dn":"On+Blondes+-+Joanna+Pitman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44e6e1144ad4f55126d42059795f264a11708f13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,230,225,20,74,212,245,81,38,212,32,89,121,95,38,74,17,112,143,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
