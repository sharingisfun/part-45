Whether with his bands like The Bluebloods, or his current Mike Henderson Band, or supporting people like Mark Knopfler, Mike has the critics and fans alike awestruck at his power! \n\nStarting off in bluegrass bands playing fiddle and mandolin, he joined a blues band just for something different. These early experiences led to a style of guitar playing he describes as &quot;half Bill Monroe and half Muddy Waters.&quot; Upon moving to Nashville, he joined a band called The Roosters.\n\nAlso a songwriter, he co-wrote the famous &quot;Powerful Stuff&quot; for The Fabulous Thunderbirds, and he's worked with everyone from Sting to The Dixie Chicks to Hank Williams, Jr., Lucinda Williams, and more. His release Edge of Night, went to number one on the Americana charts.\n\n01.I Wouldn't Lay My Guitar Down \n02.Wherever You Are \n03.Nobody's Fault But Mine \n04.The Edge Of Night \n05.One Foot In The Honky Tonk \n06.This May Be The Last Time \n07.You're So Square \n08.Honky Tonk Vacation\n(Tribute To Waylon) \n09.This Property Is Condemned \n10.Take Me Back And Try Me \n11.Drivin' Nails In My Coffin \n\nIf you like the music, buy it!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7692151776e722293c573aec15f06066622875ce","amp;dn":"Mike+Henderson+-+Edge+of+Night+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7692151776e722293c573aec15f06066622875ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,146,21,23,118,231,34,41,60,87,58,236,21,240,96,102,98,40,117,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
