A guitar here for me, a keyboard there for you. Strict music roles have no part here.\n\nOur first singles were recorded and produced by David Stephan, mixed in Toronto by Grammy award winning producer David Botrill (Tool, Peter Gabriel, King Crimson), and mastered in Windsor, Ontario by Scott Warren.\n\n\nKilling Off Characters are: Martin Foote/James Bennett/David Stephan\n\nIf you dig this release, please consider supporting indie music at:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/over-the-line-single/id662759186&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/over-the-line-single/id662759186&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/rules-for-fools-single/id662759953&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/rules-for-fools-single/id662759953&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/facts-that-lead-me-back-single/id821735188&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/facts-that-lead-me-back-single/id821735188&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThank you for listening!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:671da59411f8d574dd2dd636c0902bf85edb7f64","amp;dn":"Killing+Off+Characters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"671da59411f8d574dd2dd636c0902bf85edb7f64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,29,165,148,17,248,213,116,221,45,214,54,192,144,43,248,94,219,127,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
