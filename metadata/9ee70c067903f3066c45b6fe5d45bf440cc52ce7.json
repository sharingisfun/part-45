John Felmy, American Petroleum Institute's chief economist, points out that only about 50% of a barrel of oil is used to make gasoline. Our audience guesses which one of the items in the picture below is not made from oil:\n\nSpecial Correspondent Kennedy is a &quot;hypermiler&quot;. She shows us driving techniques to maximize fuel efficiency.\n\nFinally, I explain why Bill O'Reilly and most people are wrong to complain about the price of gas. Gas is cheap. We should thank Big Oil.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ee70c067903f3066c45b6fe5d45bf440cc52ce7","amp;dn":"20130523-Stossel-%5BGas+Myths%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ee70c067903f3066c45b6fe5d45bf440cc52ce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,231,12,6,121,3,243,6,108,69,182,254,93,69,191,68,12,197,44,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
