Specializing in the traditional Native American Northern Plains music, the 12-member group sings in their native Blackfoot language while each member beats a steady rhythm on a large, sacred buffalo drum. The group, which centers around Kenny Scabby Robe and his family, placed second in the contemporary style category at the Dance for Mother Earth Pow Wow in Ann Arbor in 1996 and placed third in 1997. In 1994, the Black Lodge Singers sang on R. Carlos Nakai and William Eaton's Grammy-winning album\nAncestral Voices. ~ Craig Harris, All Music Guide\n\nHiQuality: mp3 320kbps + cover\n\nIndigenous Music Torrents\nearthmusic.wordpress\nNative American Music Torrent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bced16947618044f39c7a3ed7a34c5c20e52a086","amp;dn":"NATIVE+AMERICAN+-+Black+Lodge+-+Enter+The+Circle+%28pow+wow+music%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bced16947618044f39c7a3ed7a34c5c20e52a086","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,237,22,148,118,24,4,79,57,199,163,237,122,52,197,194,14,82,160,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
