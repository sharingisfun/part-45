Millions of individuals suffer from partial or total hearing loss and millions of others have impaired vision. The technologies associated with augmenting these two human senses range from simple hearing aids to complex cochlear implants, and from (now commonplace) intraocular lenses to complex artificial corneas. The areas of human hearing and human sight will be described in detail with the associated array of technologies also described","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8a926ce0d94fd13c9f041907d8b763524e5830f","amp;dn":"Sensory+Organ+Replacement+and+Repair","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8a926ce0d94fd13c9f041907d8b763524e5830f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,169,38,206,13,148,253,19,201,240,65,144,125,139,118,53,36,229,131,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
