It also gives law enforcement the tools to communicate relevant information to the forensic pathologists and trains pathologists to infer crucial clues to the scenario that they may then relate to the investigating officers.\n\nBeginning with the design of the vehicle, its safety features and other mechanisms for avoiding collision or injury, the book then addresses the myriad behavioral and mitigating medical factors that impair human abilities and cause vehicular incidents. It details the correct forensic classification of injuries and reviews the direction, force, and nature of injury. Organized into incidents involving car-on-car and car-on-pedestrian, as well as bicycles, motorcycles, and heavy machinery, the book delves into extensive accounts of the various insults sustained by the body in the event of impact. This information gives trauma care practitioners the ability to quickly determine the nature and extent of the injuries sustained and allows them to provide faster more effective care to the survivors of the crash. To aid the pathologist in fulfilling the important task of finding a reasonable cause of death, the second portion of the book focuses on the postmortem examination, toxicology, and documented cause of death.\n\nWritten for all members of the investigative team, including forensic pathologists, police officers, safety engineers, and medical personnel in trauma care, Forensic Investigations of Motor Vehicle Incidents is a preliminary resource that facilitates communication among all those concerned with the causes and effects of vehicular incidents.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 240 pages\n    * Publisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (November 27, 2006)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0849378591\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0849378591","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54597508f3f85c153c090ae62f5150fa4a5c5ae3","amp;dn":"Forensic+Medical+Investigation+of+Motor+Vehicle+Accidents%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54597508f3f85c153c090ae62f5150fa4a5c5ae3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,89,117,8,243,248,92,21,60,9,10,230,47,81,80,250,74,92,90,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
