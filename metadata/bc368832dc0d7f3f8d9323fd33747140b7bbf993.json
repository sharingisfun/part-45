He was a popular figure on the U.K. club circuit, and fans will celebrate the release of this excellent album. Mitchell's father was a very good jazz and Hawaiian slide guitar player but refused to teach his son how to play, insteda encouraging him to get a job. So Mitchell taught himself how to play guitar. It was after hearing the recordings of Robert Johnson during the early '60s that he became interested in slide guitar, and by the mid-'60s he was performing in public. He first played in clubs in Liverpool, and then Brighton, and ended up in London, where he became a popular and respected performer. Mitchell first recorded in 1969, releasing a string of solo and band albums. He also made guest appearances on a number of recordings, including with Long John Baldry, Charlie Musselwhite, the Who, and Rod Stewart.\nMitchell was a natural blues vocalist, unpretentious and very much his own man. If you have no recordings by Mitchell this is a good place to start. He was a gifted musician and compelling vocalist who could write some good material of his own. His playing on guitars is controlled and atmospheric. Check him.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc368832dc0d7f3f8d9323fd33747140b7bbf993","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Sam+Mitchell+-+Art+Of+Bottleneck+Slide+Guitar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc368832dc0d7f3f8d9323fd33747140b7bbf993","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,54,136,50,220,13,127,63,141,147,35,253,51,116,113,64,183,187,249,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
