If you are looking for great straight ahead rock with a solid bass, drums and telecaster rhythm, this is the place! Stand out tracks include covers of Dirty Water, Talk Talk and Some Kind of Wonderful (all three better than the originals). Their songwriting is not bad, either, with influences as diverse as Sun Records, the Everly Brothers (minus the harmonies) and the Stones. Great party music, evoking images of hot Saturday nights in a Brit pub. I've been waiting for years for this stuff to be released and it genuinely deserves 5 stars. Guaranteed to rock your socks off!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d47733342a7e23389dae9a79c2864b76482d9c95","amp;dn":"Inmates+%285+albums%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d47733342a7e23389dae9a79c2864b76482d9c95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,119,51,52,42,126,35,56,157,174,154,121,194,134,75,118,72,45,156,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
