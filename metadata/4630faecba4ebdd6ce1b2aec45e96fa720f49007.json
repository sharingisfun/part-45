The Tupolev OKB was the first among the nation`s aircraft design bureaus to create an &quot;eye in the sky&quot;, evolving the Tu-126 AEW aircraft from the Tu-114 long-haul turboprop airliner. The aircraft entered service in 1961, filling an important role with the Soviet Air Force until replaced in the early 1980s by the Ilyushin/ Beriyev A-50 AWACS based on the IL-76MD transport. In addition to these two types, the book describes the highly unorthodox Antonov An-71 with its tail-mounted rotodome (intended for operations from a large aircraft carrier which eventually never materialized) and the Kamov Ka-31 shipboard AEW helicopter. Due mention is also made of projects that never got off the drawing board the Tu-156, IL-150 and Yakovlev Yak-44.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4630faecba4ebdd6ce1b2aec45e96fa720f49007","amp;dn":"Soviet%2FRussian+AWACS+Aircraft%3A+Tu-126%2C+A-50%2C+An-71%2C+Ka-31+-+Red+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4630faecba4ebdd6ce1b2aec45e96fa720f49007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,48,250,236,186,78,189,214,206,27,42,236,69,233,111,167,32,244,144,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
