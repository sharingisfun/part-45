He seemed kind of pissed the rest of the show, but it didn't change how cool the lights and the music were! He played a lot of his newer stuff from this album, and I loved it. So uh, enjoy and seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8f3bc008f36d3eddd3ea780f6824cad73d78f6f","amp;dn":"Todd+Rundgren+-+State+%282013%29+%5B320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8f3bc008f36d3eddd3ea780f6824cad73d78f6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,243,188,0,143,54,211,237,221,62,167,128,246,130,76,173,115,215,143,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
