Crompton (Smithers Rapra, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-84735-055-8\r\n\r\nPlastics are now being used on a large scale for the packaging of fatty and aqueous foodstuffs and beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. Thus it is likely that some transfer of polymer additives will occur - adventitious impurities such as monomers, oligomers, catalyst remnants and residual polymerisation solvents and low molecular weight polymer fractions - from the plastic into the packaged material with the consequent risk of a toxic hazard to the consumer. This book covers all aspects of the migration of additives into food and gives detailed information on the analytical determination of the additives in various plastics. This book will be of interest to those engaged in the implementation of packaging legislation, including management, analytical chemists and the manufacturers of foods, beverages, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and also scientific and toxicologists in the packaging industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1a58d4501fd2a50354dde3a3971738f5ffc3e78","amp;dn":"Additive+Migration+from+Plastics+into+Foods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1a58d4501fd2a50354dde3a3971738f5ffc3e78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,165,141,69,1,253,42,80,53,77,222,58,57,113,115,143,95,252,62,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
