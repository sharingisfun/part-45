Although the examples and explanations in this book are meant to work on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, you should find them quite equally useful for developing for webOS, Android, or the browser from the latest BlackBerry devices, as well as for any modern desktop browser.\n\nThis book will be useful also to native application developers because resorting to the UIWebView from the iOS SDK is often necessary to gain more control over the interface of your applications, and getting a firm grasp on the latest advances of the technologies presented in this book can be of great help.\n\nBook details :\n\nTitle : beginning iphone and ipad web apps\nSize : 17.8 Mb\nPages : 497\nLanguage : English\nFormat : pdf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c74731ca2566bde9b3a51907c481b1eb8d167ac","amp;dn":"beginning+iphone+and+ipad+web+apps++%7B+UPPOG2+%7D+Torrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c74731ca2566bde9b3a51907c481b1eb8d167ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,116,115,28,162,86,107,222,155,58,81,144,124,72,27,30,184,209,103,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
