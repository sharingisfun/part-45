The new CD contains JesseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s usual quota of moving, understated, wry and thoughtful songs of lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s transient pleasures (Ã¢â‚¬Å“All That We Have Is NowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), tongue-in-cheek rockers (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Never Forget to BoogieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and his uneasy peace with his Ã¢â‚¬â€ and everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬â€ eventual fate (the heartwrenching Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just So MuchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). A Reasonable Amount of Trouble is tinged with an awareness of mortality but not a drop of self-pity, just unforgettable new compositions plus versions of the sweet oldies he enjoyed so much (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rhythm of the Rain,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Devil or Angel,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whispering BellsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).\n\nThe new CD was produced by Mac McAnally, who also plays lead guitar (and has performed both functions for Jimmy Buffett, among others, for years). Jesse plays acoustic guitar and keyboard and sings in his uniquely weightless tenor, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an attuned rhythm section, and guest appearances by Ã¢â‚¬Å“newgrassÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ country Grammy winner Jerry Douglas on lap steel and legendary saxophonist Jim Horn, among others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ca4d6090a26c2a02978d582ea4fd31bb59cfdea","amp;dn":"Jesse+Winchester+-+A+Reasonable+Amount+of+Trouble+%5B2014%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ca4d6090a26c2a02978d582ea4fd31bb59cfdea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,164,214,9,10,38,194,160,41,120,213,130,234,79,211,27,181,156,253,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
