Published by Avatar Press.\n\n**I dont own or take credit for any of the content contained in this torrent, all credit goes to the creator(s) of the comic.**\n\n\nDescription:\n\nSet in the excess of the late 1970s we follow the world as it has evolved with the zombie threat, a disaster they thought they had under control. When the city is locked down with quarantine, a group of survivors finds out the hard way that even with the undead, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. And in this case it means a female punk rock zombie fetishist has to grow up in a hurry when her hedonistic boyfriend is bitten by a real ghoul. No more fun and games - it's time for a horror tale that rips you out of the safe zone with a fast paced violent survival story.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8d5b59bb92da1c5c19429bc87405586c1a99992","amp;dn":"Night+of+the+Living+Dead+-+Aftermath+%5BUp+To+Date%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8d5b59bb92da1c5c19429bc87405586c1a99992","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,213,181,155,185,45,161,197,193,148,41,188,135,64,85,134,193,169,153,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
