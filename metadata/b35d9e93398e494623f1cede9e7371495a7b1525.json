We eat what we grow.&quot; - Nancy Singleton Hachisu,\n\nJapanese Farm Food offers a unique window into life on a Japanese farm through the simple, clear-flavored recipes cooked from family crops and other local, organic products. The multitude of vibrant images by Kenji Miura of green fields, a traditional farmhouse, antique baskets, and ceramic bowls filled with beautiful, simple dishes are interwoven with Japanese indigo fabrics to convey an intimate, authentic portrait of life and food on a Japanese farm. With a focus on fresh and thoughtfully sourced ingredients, the recipes in Japanese Farm Food are perfect for fans of farmers' markets, and for home cooks looking for accessible Japanese dishes. Personal stories about family and farm life complete this incredible volume.\n\nAmerican born and raised, Nancy Singleton Hachisu lives with her husband and teenage sons on a rural Japanese farm, where they prepare these 160 bright, seasonal dishes. The recipes are organized logically with the intention of reassuring you how easy it is to cook Japanese food. Not just a book about Japanese food, Japanese Farm Food is a book about love, life on the farm, and community. Covering everything from pickles and soups to noodles, rice, and dipping sauces, with a special emphasis on vegetables, Hachisu demystifies the rural Japanese kitchen, laying bare the essential ingredients, equipment, and techniques needed for Japanese home cooking.\n\n\nAuthor: Nancy Singleton Hachisu, Kenji Miura\nTitle: Japanese Farm Food\nPublisher: Andrews McMeel Publishing\nYear: 2012\nISBN: 1449418295\nFormat: EPUB/PDF\n\n\nENJOY AND SEED!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b35d9e93398e494623f1cede9e7371495a7b1525","amp;dn":"Japanese+Farm+Food+-+2010kaiser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b35d9e93398e494623f1cede9e7371495a7b1525","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,93,158,147,57,142,73,70,35,241,206,222,158,115,113,73,90,123,21,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
