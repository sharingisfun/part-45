The stage is described as a burnt-out warehouse, and much of what happens is done with video projection. But this isn't video projection on a big screen; this is video projection as a set element, more like a live film. \n\n\n---\n\nFormat: flv\nSize: 523mb\nTime: 80min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74532741358a37ab07188f8aa8c6effb45a51ce3","amp;dn":"Jonsi+in+Concert+%28live+from+NPR+webcast%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74532741358a37ab07188f8aa8c6effb45a51ce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,83,39,65,53,138,55,171,7,24,143,138,168,198,239,251,69,165,28,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
