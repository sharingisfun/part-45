Macindows combines Wine and X11 in a way that ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­s easy to use and affordable.\n\n\n\nWhen you think about it, what really stops you running Windows programs on Apple hardware? The modern Apple computer uses an Intel processor. From a hardware point of view, there is very little difference between Macintosh and PC. Only one thing stands in the way: software. Macs run OS X, PCs run Windows.\n\n\n\nBut suppose there was a piece of software running on Macs that converted Windows operating system requests into Mac OS X requests. Enter Macindows.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's New in Version 0.8:\n\n\n\n\nSupport for shared 32/64-bit setups.\nDwarf debug info support for better backtraces.\nMore standard actions supported in MSI.\nSupport for TIFF image format in WinCodecs.\nA number of Direct3D improvements.\nShell fixes for better Internet Explorer support.\nVarious bug fixes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@artpepper says: Please accept my apologies but I don't know if this is cracked or if it's just the 30-Day Free Trial version. I'm almost sure it's cracked (considering the source) but I could be wrong. I'm not a Mac-user but I thought this looked like a useful app for people who are, so I've uploaded it. Please let me know if it works properly.\n\n\nLink for more information: http://www.pioneeringsoftware.co.uk/pages/products\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:448b330a129899ed0fc41c76ba3db7ead28d7123","amp;dn":"Macindows+0.8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"448b330a129899ed0fc41c76ba3db7ead28d7123","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,139,51,10,18,152,153,237,15,196,28,118,186,61,183,234,210,141,113,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
