In 1985, Mel recorded two \ndemos solo, under Alan Whitehead's management. The producers loved her voice and \nthey asked her if she would have someone to sing with. That's how Kim got involved. \nThe girls recorded about five demos [according to Mr. Whitehead]. One of these \nsongs - &quot;Wild and Crazy Love&quot;,a Mary Jane Girls cover - can be heard on the Mel \nand Kim documentary on YouTube. The demos got them signed with Supreme Records, \nand Nick East - president of Supreme - put them in touch with Stock \nAitken Waterman.\n\n\n  01.
