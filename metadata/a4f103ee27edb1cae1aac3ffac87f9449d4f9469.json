The journal tells of the dichotomy of combat operations versus nation building. It vividly captures the stresses of combat and corresponding emotions as they accumulate over time in a combat outfit. It reinforces the ideal of camaraderie among soldiers and deals with the emotional impact of losing friends in battle. Understanding these could prove invaluable to those who courageously serve our nation and will continue to endure them in this and future conflicts.\n\n\nPaperback: 296 pages\nPublisher: Dept. of the Army (June 29, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0160787068\nISBN-13: 978-0160787065","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4f103ee27edb1cae1aac3ffac87f9449d4f9469","amp;dn":"Battleground+Iraq-Journal+of+a+Company+Commander+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4f103ee27edb1cae1aac3ffac87f9449d4f9469","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,241,3,238,39,237,177,202,225,170,195,255,172,135,249,68,157,79,148,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
