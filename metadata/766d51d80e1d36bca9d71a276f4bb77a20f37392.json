For National Geographic.\n\n\nCodebreakers is the story of the science behind secrecy- how codes work, what they do and why we need them. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not dry or technical, because codebreaking is where science meets adventure- these are great tales of hard thinking, but also heroic risks, cat-and-mouse secrecy and high stakes. We get inside the minds of the code writers and breakers to reveal the skills of the clever yet unsung heroes of this life or death science.\n\n\nToday codes have become the foundation that underpins our entire globe. Secret information passes every second every day across continents using codes known only to the sender and recipient. Every time you log your computer onto a favourite website, go shopping, use your phone and drive a car, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re using the science of secret codes. And as well as the serious stuff, all over the world, thousands of enthusiasts, professionals and nutters devote their lives to cracking some of the greatest- and strangest- unsolved mysteries concealed in codes.\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: D.B:Sweeney\n========================\n\nDirected by: Mel Morpeth\n========================\n\nProduced by: Jenni Butterworth\n==============================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Code Breakers\nYear.................:    2007\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:45:33\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    4:3\n\nVideo Codec..........:    H263\nVideo Resolution.....:    640x480\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2503 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    815 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2007\n\n\n\n\n[HDTV/H263:]\n\n\n       \nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:766d51d80e1d36bca9d71a276f4bb77a20f37392","amp;dn":"Code+Breakers-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"766d51d80e1d36bca9d71a276f4bb77a20f37392","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,109,81,216,14,29,54,188,169,215,26,39,111,75,183,122,32,243,115,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
