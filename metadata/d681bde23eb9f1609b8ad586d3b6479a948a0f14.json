Her attempt to live out her life as Lily Azerov shatters as she disappears, leaving a new husband and baby daughter, and a host of unanswered questions. Who is she really and what happened to the young woman whose identity she has stolen? Why has she left and where did she go? It is left to the daughter she abandoned to find the answers to these questions as she searches for the mother she may never find or really know.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d681bde23eb9f1609b8ad586d3b6479a948a0f14","amp;dn":"The+Imposter+Bride+by+Nancy+Richler+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d681bde23eb9f1609b8ad586d3b6479a948a0f14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,129,189,226,62,185,241,96,155,138,213,134,211,182,71,154,148,138,15,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
