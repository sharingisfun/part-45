Master devastating attacks and vanquish your enemies in this epic struggle between good and evil!\n\n\nA 2D fighting game with anime characters&quot;\n\nIntroduction\n\nSpectral vs. Generation is a 2D fighting game.\n\nI haven't been playing the game for long, so this review is based on my initial impression.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics are superb. The animation, which is of a Japanese Ã¢â‚¬Ëœanime' style, is quite smooth. The moves look impressive, whether it is a fiery projectile, a lengthy combo, or a spinning sword.\n\nGameplay\n\nControls\n\nThe basic attacks are quick, medium, strong and kick. The quick, medium and strong attacks are usually done with a weapon such as a sword.\n\nLike with most fighting games, the special moves can be done with the right button combinations e.g. down, then forward, then kick.\n\nThere is an energy bar that fills up when attacks are made. The bar is split into three segments. Each character has a set of level 2 special moves that expend one segment of the energy bar. These moves involve making a lengthier combination than usual, such a down, forward, down, forward, attack. Compared to the other special moves, these energy spending moves deal more damage, often hit multiple times, and look more impressive graphically. Each character also has one level 3 special move that expends the entire energy bar.\n\nCompared to other 2D fighting games, it is hard to get by with just the basic attacks. Special moves tend to do a lot more damage than basic attacks. Special moves (especially energy expending ones), are often the key to victory.\n\nCharacters\n\nThere are 10 characters plus a few unlockable ones. Of those characters 5 are human, 4 are demons and 1 is an angel.\n\nThe most notable characters include:\n\nEril - A boy with two swords. Several of his special moves involve summoning his guardian (also with two swords). His short stature can make him harder to hit. When summoned, his guardian will appear directly above him, making the guardian great for medium height and anti-aerial attacks.\n\nOrochimaru - A samurai. This character has many special moves that require a prerequisite special move to be made. I believe this character would be very powerful if played by a highly skilled player who can pull off lengthy chains of special moves.\n\nOther characters include: a scythe wielder with fire based moves; a demon with two tendrils used as weapons; a guy with a huge sword; a martial artist that doesn't use weapons; and an angel that uses his wings as a weapon.\n\nReviewer's Score: 7/10 | Originally Posted: 09/28/09\n\nGame Release: Spectral vs Generation (EU, 07/25/07)\n\n\n9- Marvel Vs Capcom 2 New Age of Heroes NTSC-U\n\nBased on the arcade smash hit of the same name, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 challenges players to rule the arena of two of the world's most powerful fighting universes. MvC2 offers an unprecedented 56 playable characters, three-on-three tag team battles, insane combat speeds, and various assist types for all sorts of gaming strategies.
