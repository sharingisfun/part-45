Sporting a brand new (or unCommon) sound, the song was meant to be released this summer, as a part of Common&amp;#039;s 8th studio album, &quot;Invincible Summer&quot;. Thus the &quot;electro-tinged&quot; and &quot;techno-inspired&quot; sound. The album has been pushed and pushed, and final release date is now Dec. 9th. 2008.\n\nThe beat is hypnotic like nothing I&amp;#039;ve heard in a while.\nAlso, insane video by Hype Williams. YouTube it. \n\nSorry for the low bitrate. Then again, you&amp;#039;re going to bang this in headphones anyway:)\n\nBitrate: 128 kps\nLength: 3m30s\n\n\n\nMy first torrent, btw. Sorry for any mistakes.\n\n\nNemOz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a5f0a8d81afebb5c5ebf3647608e5d40a9788e4","amp;dn":"Common+ft.+Pharrell+-+Universal+Mind+Control","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a5f0a8d81afebb5c5ebf3647608e5d40a9788e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,95,10,141,129,175,235,181,197,235,243,100,118,8,229,212,10,151,136,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
