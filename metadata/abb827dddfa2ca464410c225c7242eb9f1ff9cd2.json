The album was recorded at the Rainbow Theatre in London on 5 May 1973. A studio album was initially slated for release, but it was shelved due to disagreements within the band. (An album compiled from the tapes of these sessions was later released with the title Ship of Memories.) At the Rainbow was released instead.\n\nFLAC\n\nFocus\n\nAt The Rainbow\n\n1973\n\nCD - No artwork\n\n&quot;Focus III&quot; (Thijs van Leer) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:52\n&quot;Answers? Questions! Questions?
