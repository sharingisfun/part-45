From track one, aptly titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFull Frontal Shotgun,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ it bleeds of rock-and-roll western; kicking ass and reloading cue after cue. He makes frequent use of electric and acoustic guitars, ricocheting between a hard rock attitude and countrified simplicity, adding depth to the characterization one might not notice by watching alone. As one delves deeper into the score, horrific, hellish tones creep to the surface. Wandmacher is a master of integrating eerie aural dissonance into his work, and on tracks like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBurning MemoriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNot of This Earth,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Christopher Young plus Charlie Clouser multiplied by Bernard HerrmannÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ style erupts in skin-flaying intensity.\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n1.
