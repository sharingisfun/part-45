Proud and brave, she lives for the thrill of the hunt and for the friendship of her fellow female warriors. Then, because her mother demands it and in defiance of the laws of her people, she must take her newborn brother to his father in Troy, where she finds herself in terrible danger.\n\nTo save her people, Hippolyta must defy the gods -- and even accept the help of a boy -- and learn what it really means to be an Amazon: finding the courage to change her world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0baf7bcb61cfc159083482fc0e73655382d4b62c","amp;dn":"Hippolyta+and+the+Curse+of+the+Amazons+-+Robert+J.+Harris+%26amp%3B+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0baf7bcb61cfc159083482fc0e73655382d4b62c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,175,123,203,97,207,193,89,8,52,130,252,14,115,101,83,130,212,182,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
