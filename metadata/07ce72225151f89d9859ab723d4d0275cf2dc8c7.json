He yearned to have a submarine of his very own, and decades later, following a successful career as an engineer and entrepreneur, Robbins had the wherewithal to try to build one. Never did he imagine, however, that his quest would turn into a 10-year odyssey testing both his financial resources and his usually tireless good humor. In the following interview, Robbins describes the bumpy journey.\n                \n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Neil Ross\n----------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nHDTV:\n-----\n\n\nTitle: Underwater Dream Machine\nYear:  2006\nFile Size: 598 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:52:59\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 720x416\nVIdeo Bitrate:  1580 kbit/s\nFPS:  29.969999\nAudio Bitrate: 132 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (N/A)\n\n\n\n\nIMDB:  \n\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n                  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07ce72225151f89d9859ab723d4d0275cf2dc8c7","amp;dn":"Underwater+Dream+Machine-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07ce72225151f89d9859ab723d4d0275cf2dc8c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,206,114,34,81,81,248,157,152,89,171,114,61,77,2,117,207,45,200,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
