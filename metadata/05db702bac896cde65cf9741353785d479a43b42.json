This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nThis is the last three hours of a four hour show. I supplied the ten missing songs. If you don't want to play them, skip all the files that start with double zero.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey calls one singer-songwriter in the countdown the most successful recording act since The Beatles.\n\nSince Andy Gibb's first three singles went to number one, a listener wants to know if any acts have ever had their first three albums go to number one. Casey says three acts have had their first FOUR albums hit number one, and gives the details.\n\nThere is a hit by the artist who was the first solo artist ever to have three separate singles from the same album on the hot 100 all at the same time.\n\nThe brand new number one song this week is &quot;Le Freak&quot; by Chic, making them only the second group ever to hit number one on the Pop, Soul, and Disco charts with the same song at the same time.\n\n40: I Was Made For Dancing - Leif Garrett\n39: My Best Friend's Girl - The Cars\n38: Can You Fool - Glen Campbell\n37: Instant Replay - Dan Hartman\n36: There Will Never Be - Switch\n35: A Little More Love - Olivia Newton-John\n34: You Never Done It Like That - The Captain  &amp; Tennille\n33: Run For Home - Lindisfarne\n32: Everyone's A Winner - Hot Chocolate\n31: Bicycle Race - Queen\n\n\n30: New York Groove - Ace Frehley\n29: Ready To Take A Chance Again - Barry Manilow\n28: You Needed Me - Anne Murray\nLDD: Just Remember I Love You - Firefall\n27: I'm Every Woman - Chakakahn\n26: Promises - Eric Clapton\n25: We've Got Tonight - Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullitt Band\n24:  - Dan Fogelberg\n23: Part-Time Love - Elton John\n22: Ooh Baby Baby - Linda Ronstadt\n21: Don't Want To Live Without It - Pablo Cruise\nARCHIVE: It's Too Late / I Feel The Earth Move - Carole King\n20: How You Gonna See Me Now - Alice Cooper\n19:  Change Of Heart - Eric Carmen\n18: Sweet Life - Paul Davis\n17: Double Vision - Foreigner\n16: Straight On - Heart\nEXTRA: Waterloo - Abba\n15: Hold The Line - Toto\n14: Alive Again - Chicago\n13: Y.M.C.A. - Village People\n12: Too Much Heaven - Bee Gees\n11: Strange Way - Firefall\nARCHIVE: Indian Reservation - The Raiders\n10: Our Love: Don't Throw It All Away - Andy Gibb\n9: Sharing The Night Together - Dr. Hook\n8: My Life - Billy Joel\n7: Time Passages - Al Stewart\nEXTRA: You're So Vain - Carly Simon\n6: I Love The Nightlife - Alicia Bridges\n5: How Much I Feel - Ambrosia\nLDD: Precious And Few - Climax\n4: I Just Want To Stop - Gino Vanelli\n3: You Don't Bring Me Flowers Anymore - Barbra Streisand &amp; Neil Diamond\n2: MacArthur Park - Donna Summer\n1: Le Freak - Chic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05db702bac896cde65cf9741353785d479a43b42","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1978_December_9th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05db702bac896cde65cf9741353785d479a43b42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,219,112,43,172,137,108,222,101,207,151,65,53,55,133,212,121,164,59,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
