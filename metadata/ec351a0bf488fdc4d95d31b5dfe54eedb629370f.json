Hardy played keyboards in an area band called Shrinkwrap before striking out on her own. After writing a few songs, she drafted drummer/keyboardist Micah Calabrese to collaborate with her; after auditioning several other potential members, the duo decided to stay a duo. Giant Drag appeared on the Fold compilation and earned a following in the U.K., where noted indie label Wichita signed the band. The Lemona EP arrived in 2004; soon after its release, Calabrese was replaced by new drummer/keyboardist Eli. Lemona saw a U.S. release in early 2005. The band's debut full-length album, Hearts &amp; Unicorns, followed in September.&quot;\n\nhttP://www.giantdrag.com\n\nGo buy the cd if you like it\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000AOF9T8/qid=1134089417/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-5696609-9009748?v=glance&amp;s=music","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec351a0bf488fdc4d95d31b5dfe54eedb629370f","amp;dn":"Giant+Drag+-+Hearts+and+Unicorns+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec351a0bf488fdc4d95d31b5dfe54eedb629370f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,53,26,11,244,136,253,196,217,93,49,181,223,229,78,237,182,41,55,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
