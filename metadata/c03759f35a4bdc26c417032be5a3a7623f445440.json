Re-wrote the GUI to easily allow for more features to be added.\n   2. The &quot;follow&quot; feature was added to the bot.\n   3. Added a login Button.\n   4. Improved the login. The bot should now only login if required.\n   5. Moved certain code to their own include files, this should make it easier to\n      develop the bot further! &quot;This is simplifying the code...&quot;\n\n Script Function:\n\tThe Best Twitter Bot\n\t Unfollow Your Non-Followers\n\t Follow Following/Followers of User\n\nThe source code for the bot is included for those interested. If your security/antivirus flags the .exe, then it is a false posetive. Compiled AutoIt scripts often get flagged without reason, even the source files can sometimes get flagged.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03759f35a4bdc26c417032be5a3a7623f445440","amp;dn":"The+Best+Twitter+Bot+V2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03759f35a4bdc26c417032be5a3a7623f445440","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,55,89,243,90,75,220,38,196,23,3,43,229,163,167,98,63,68,84,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
