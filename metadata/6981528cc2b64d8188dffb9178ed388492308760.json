Finally, in early 2012, they resurfaced with a full-length, self-titled album for Merge that expands on the promise of the EP and delivers a nice combo of sophisticated wit, musical surprises, and emotional punch. Its something bands like Camera Obscura and the Concretes were able to achieve again and again, and Hospitality shares much with these two bands. First thing would be a vocalist, Amber Papini, who sounds a little weird at first but not in an off-putting way, more in a way that draws you in and leaves you hanging on each oddly phrased word. Second thing is very catchy tunes that will have you humming along right way. Papinis songs are unstoppably charming, with equal doses of free-spirited joy, hard-won knowledge, and semi-crushing melancholy. \n\n  She writes about growing up, growing apart, falling in love, and getting by in a way that is both thoughtful and revealing, but never self-centered or insular. The third thing would be a level of musical intelligence and inspiration that lifts them above the hordes of drab indie lifers they share airspace with, and they have this to spare. Papini and the group -- drummer Nathan Michel (who also provides keys, guitars, backing vocals, and co-production) and bassist Brian Betancourt -- play Hospitality with a refined and steady grace that improves greatly on the bedroom sound of the EP and adds just the right amount of depth to quiet and thoughtful songs like Julie and Sleepover.  Overall, there is a fine balance of sounds, feelings, and textures on the album, enough to make Hospitality both a vindication of promise already displayed by the band and hope for further greatness. That, and it just plain sounds good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6981528cc2b64d8188dffb9178ed388492308760","amp;dn":"Hospitality+-+Hospitality+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+politux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6981528cc2b64d8188dffb9178ed388492308760","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,129,82,140,194,182,77,129,136,223,251,145,120,237,56,132,146,48,135,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
