Disfigured by an abusive father, the teenager hides behind his books and an impenetrable wall of cynicism and anger.\n\nAs AndyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother struggles to reconnect with him, his Uncle Rip returns transformed from a stint in prison and wants to be a mentor to the reclusive boy, doing everything he can to help end AndyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pain. When Andy begins hearing strange music through his iPod and making near-prophetic announcements, Rip is convinced that what Andy is hearing is the voice of God.\n\nElsewhere, police officer Heather Gerisch responds to a late-night breaking and entering in one of the poorest homes in town. She soon realizes that the masked prowler has left thousands of dollars in gift cards from a local grocery store.\n\nAs the bizarre break-ins continue and Heather pursues the elusive Ã¢â‚¬Å“Summer Santa,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Andy and Rip discover an enormous and well-kept garden of wildflowers that seems to have grown overnight at an abandoned steel mill.\n\nSoon, they realize who the gardener is, and a spree of miracles transfigures this small town from a place of hopelessness into a place of healing and beauty.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:759d89eb403b969a255f8092ae5f36cbd35f893a","amp;dn":"The+Sinners%27+Garden+-+William+Sirls.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"759d89eb403b969a255f8092ae5f36cbd35f893a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,157,137,235,64,59,150,154,37,95,128,146,174,95,54,203,211,95,137,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
