William Davies King, on the other hand, has devoted decades to collecting nothingÃ¢â‚¬â€and a lot of it. With Collections of Nothing, he takes a hard look at this habitual hoarding to see what truths it can reveal about the impulse to accumulate.\n\nPart memoir, part reflection on the mania of acquisition, Collections of Nothing begins with the stamp collection that King was given as a boy. In the following years, rather than rarity or pedigree, he found himself searching out the lowly and the lost, the cast-off and the undesired: objects that, merely by gathering and retaining them, he could imbue with meaning, even value. As he relates the story of his burgeoning collections, King also offers a fascinating meditation on the human urge to collect. This wry, funny, even touching appreciation and dissection of the collectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s art as seen through the life of a most unusual specimen will appeal to anyone who has ever felt the unappeasable power of that acquisitive fever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8378fd4b8472d7cc4609d273845975cea3eec1c","amp;dn":"Collections+of+Nothing+by+William+Davies+King++%28retail+pdf%29+%5Bmob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8378fd4b8472d7cc4609d273845975cea3eec1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,55,143,212,184,71,45,124,196,96,157,39,56,69,151,92,234,62,236,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
