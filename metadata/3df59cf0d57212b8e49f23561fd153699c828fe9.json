Abbott and Michael T. Fisher drew on their unparalleled experience managing some of the world's highest transaction volume Web sites to cover everything IT and business leaders need to know to build smoothly scaling technology infrastructures.

Scalability Rules takes a direct approach by presenting fundamental principles in an easily read and digestible format for rapid application to almost any technical environment. It will be useful to all readers as a primer, a refresher, and as a reference. Its principles can be used to form the basis of architectural strategy for just about any company dealing with hypergrowth in the Web 2.0 world. **This book is currently available in Rough Cut format; as the authors write chapters they will be added here.
