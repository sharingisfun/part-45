The music was done on commission by German-American composer Paul Hindemith.\n\nThe score is built around the concept of the four classical personalities, and is split into five parts. The first, the theme, goes through highs and lows, frantic at times, subdued at others. The four variations follow, replaying the theme through the lens of each of the temperaments; from the contemplative adagio of &quot;Melancholisch&quot; to the forceful vivance of &quot;Cholerisch&quot;.\n\nThis is a 1986 Royal Philharmonic Orchestra recording of that score as conducted by the late James DePreist, called by the Chicago Tribune &quot;One of the finest conductors this nation has produced,&quot; with Carol Rosenberger on piano. In addition, the last 3 tracks are the suite from the earlier Hindemith work Nobilissima Visione, a ballet detailing the life of Saint Francis of Assisi. The ballet premiÃƒÂ¨red in 1938 in London, shortly after Hindemith and his ethnically Jewish wife fled Nazi Germany.\n\nThough the highly resonant Nobilissima Visione is perhaps better known than The Four Temperaments, both are given excellent treatment by all those involved. The RPO (under the direction of DePreist) has rarely sounded better.\n\n----\n\nIf you have any issues, it'll be a result of my being relatively new to this. Just shout at me for being a moron in the comments, and I'll see what I can do to fix things. Otherwise, enjoy the music, and please, seed generously.\n\n----\n\nTechnical details:\nAudio: 320 kb/s\nRuntime: 00:51:22\n\n8 files, 118 MB total\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0a89022918a9db9e3cb0c3fccad7c46b1e40b07","amp;dn":"Hindemith%3A+The+Four+Temperaments%2C+Nobilissima+Visione+Suite+%28198","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0a89022918a9db9e3cb0c3fccad7c46b1e40b07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,168,144,34,145,138,157,185,227,203,12,63,204,173,124,70,177,228,11,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
