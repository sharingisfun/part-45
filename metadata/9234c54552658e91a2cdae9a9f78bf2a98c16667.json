Aquaculture engineering requires knowledge of the many general aspects of engineering such as material technology, building design and construction, mechanical engineering, and environmental engineering. In this comprehensive book now in its second edition, author Odd-Ivar Lekang introduces these principles and demonstrates how such technical knowledge can be applied to aquaculture systems.\r\n\r\nReview of the first edition:\r\n\r\n'Fish farmers and other personnel involved in the aquaculture industry, suppliers to the fish farming business and designers and manufacturers will find this book an invaluable resource. The book will be an important addition to the shelves of all libraries in universities and research institutions where aquaculture, agriculture and environmental sciences are studied and taught.'\r\n\r\nAquaculture Europe\r\n\r\n'A useful book that, hopefully, will inspire successors that focus more on warm water aquaculture and on large-scale mariculture such as tuna farming.'\r\n\r\nCision","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9234c54552658e91a2cdae9a9f78bf2a98c16667","amp;dn":"Aquaculture+Engineering+2nd+ed+-+Odd-Ivar+Lekang","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9234c54552658e91a2cdae9a9f78bf2a98c16667","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,52,197,69,82,101,142,145,162,205,174,154,159,120,191,42,152,193,102,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
