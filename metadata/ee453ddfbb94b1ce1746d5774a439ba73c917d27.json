Unfortunately, the calculator itself can be difficult to use if the student doesn't take the time to learn the functions.\n\nThis DVD set will teach the student how to use the HP50g using step-by-step video examples.  This way, the student learns by doing rather than reading a dry manual.\n\nTotal DVD Run Time: 7 Hours\n\nDisk 1\nSection 1: Overview of the HP50G Calculator\nSection 2: Using Algebraic and RPN Modes\nSection 3: Using the Menu System\nSection 4: The Mode Menu\nSection 5: Basic Calculations and Working with Fractions\nSection 6: Using the Equation Writer\nSection 7: Advanced Uses of the Equation Writer\nSection 8: Creating, Using, and Deleting Variables\nSection 9: The Inverse Function, Parenthesis, Absolute Value\nSection 10: Calculating with Powers and Roots\nSection 11: Logarithms and Exponential Functions\nSection 12: Scientific Notation and Trigonometric Functions\nSection 13: The Math Menu\nSection 14: Hyperbolic Functions\n\nDisk 2\nSection 15: Units and Unit Conversions\nSection 16: The Constants Library\nSection 17: The Equation Library\nSection 18: Graphing Single Equations\nSection 19: Graphing Multiple Equations and Intersection Points\nSection 20: Finding Slope, Area, and Derivatives in Graph Mode\nSection 21: Working with Complex Numbers\nSection 22: The Complex Number Menu\nSection 23: Solving Equations Symbolically\nSection 24: Solving Systems of Equations Symbolically\nSection 25: Finding Roots of Polynomials\nSection 26: Solving Equations Numerically\nSection 27: Solving Polynomial Roots Numerically\nSection 28: Solving Linear Systems Numerically\nSection 29: Solving More Complicated Systems Numerically\nSection 30: Working with Vectors\nSection 31: Working with Matrices\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee453ddfbb94b1ce1746d5774a439ba73c917d27","amp;dn":"Math+Tutor+-+HP+50g+Tutorials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee453ddfbb94b1ce1746d5774a439ba73c917d27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,69,61,223,187,148,177,206,23,70,213,119,74,67,155,167,60,145,125,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
