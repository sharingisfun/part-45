She has received 11 Emmy nominations. Before her long stint in talk shows, Gifford's first television exposure was that of Tom Kennedy's singer/sidekick on Name That Tune, from 1974 to 1978.\n\nOn April 7, 2008, Gifford began co-hosting the fourth hour of NBC's Today Show, along with Hoda Kotb.\n\nIn 1970, Gifford represented Maryland in America's Junior Miss Pageant.\n\nDuring one summer in the early 1970s, she was a live-in secretary/babysitter for Anita Bryant at her home in Miami. Gifford's career took off in the 1970s (during her first marriage to Christian composer/arranger/producer/publisher Paul Johnson) as a vocalist on the game show Name That Tune with Tom Kennedy (she performed the &quot;sing a tune&quot; segment as Kathie Lee Johnson). In 1978, she joined the cast of the short-lived Hee Haw sitcom spinoff, Hee Haw Honeys.\n\nGifford appeared in television advertisements for Carnival Cruise Lines beginning in 1984. The ads were the first cruise line ads to air on network television.\n\nFollowing her divorce from Johnson in 1983, Gifford met sports commentator Frank Gifford during an episode of ABC's Good Morning America; the couple married in 1986. They share the same birthday, 23 years apart.\n\nBy that time, she was several months into her most famous television role, as a full-time morning talk show personality. On June 24, 1985, she replaced Ann Abernathy as co-host of The Morning Show on WABC-TV with Regis Philbin. The program went into national broadcast in 1988, as Live with Regis and Kathie Lee and Gifford became well-known across the country. Throughout the 1990s, millions of morning-TV viewers watched her descriptions of life at home with her sportscaster husband and their two children: son Cody Newton Gifford (born in 1990) and Cassidy Erin Gifford (born in 1993). She appeared as a spokesperson for Slim Fast diet shakes after Cody was born.\n\nSince Live, Gifford has made guest appearances in films and television series, and has several independently released albums on CD, including 2000's The Heart of a Woman, featuring the single &quot;Love Never Fails&quot;.\n\nIn September 2005 she became a special correspondent on The Insider, a syndicated entertainment magazine television show, ending her relationship with that program upon her co-hosting role with Today.\n\nGifford appeared as Miss Hannigan in a concert performance of Annie at Madison Square Garden in December 2006.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:683e7a6a4bcf2979317c1ad06d8bdb7051909379","amp;dn":"Kathie+Lee+Gifford+-+Love+Never+Fails+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"683e7a6a4bcf2979317c1ad06d8bdb7051909379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,62,122,106,75,207,41,121,49,124,26,208,109,139,219,112,81,144,147,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
