George Kennedy, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066605/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe title Zig Zag refers not only to the twisty plot but to the manner of its telling. The first act is handled elliptically, jumping around in time and allowing the audience to figure out what insurance agent Paul Cameron is up to. The film begins with his arrest surrounded by reporters and circles back to it, but before the credits we get a lengthy virtual documentary on the process of being booked; those who have been waiting all their lives for a George Kennedy nude scene have it here. Through this highly edited approach of close-ups and wide shots, it gradually becomes clear that our protagonist has framed himself for the murder of an industrialist who was kidnapped a year ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x368, 23.976 fps, 1949 Kbps, 01h44m05s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, optional Swedish subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5ju34f6dl/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/lu8705z69/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/d0haj2c7l/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/qjy4orq6p/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/cc8g04dht/\r\n\r\ncredit ripper e----e","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b178fc360742a039a1860319e76a9609cbabf54","amp;dn":"Zig+Zag+%281970+-+George+Kennedy%2C+Eli+Wallach%29+thriller+swe+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b178fc360742a039a1860319e76a9609cbabf54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,23,143,195,96,116,42,3,154,24,96,49,158,118,169,96,156,186,191,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
