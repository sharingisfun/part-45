The album got a lot of media coverage for being the first album to be released without an actual CD in the convolute, instead it included a digital download code that you enter on the band's website and then they gave you the choice to either spare the environment by keeping it digital, or burn it out and place it in the convolute. \n\n&quot;Goliath And The Giants&quot;\n\n01.
