Bruno Ganz is Damiel, an angel perched atop buildings high over Berlin who can hear the thoughtsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½fears, hopes, dreamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½of all the people living below. But when he falls in love with a beautiful trapeze artist, he is willing to give up his immortality and come back to earth to be with her. Made not long before the fall of the Berlin wall, this stunning tapestry of sounds and images, shot in black and white and color by the legendary Henri Alekan, is movie poetry. And it forever made the name Wim Wenders synonymous with film art.\n\nThe movie was made with a minimal script; it is a mood piece exploring people, the city, and a concept: a longing for and love of life, existence, reality. Peter Falk wasn't meant to be a sketch artist until Wenders discovered Falk's talent. Bruno Ganz and Otto Sander were cast because they were old friends, who had known each other for decades. Solveig Dommartin was Wenders' actress girlfriend; although the circus part required extensive and risky acrobatics, she was able to learn the trapeze and rope moves in only eight weeks, and did all the work herself, with no stunt doubles and without a net.\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\Wings of Desire (1987)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\Wings of Desire (1987)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                   : OpenDML\nFile size                        : 2.61 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 7mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 931 Kbps\nWriting application              : Lavf51.12.1\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 2h 7mn\nBit rate                         : 2 600 Kbps\nWidth                            : 852 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.265\nStream size                      : 2.32 GiB (89%)\nWriting library                  : Lavc51.40.4\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 2h 7mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nStream size                      : 292 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 26 ms (0.63 video frame)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.46\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5209\n\nWindows 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3\nInternet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702\n\n11/29/2010 3:20:56 AM\nmbam-log-2010-11-29 (03-20-56).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 6\nTime elapsed: 8 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
