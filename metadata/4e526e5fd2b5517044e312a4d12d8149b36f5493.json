The tracks David Byrne has written for this release\ncombine an array of atmospheric and tantalizing music. These themes gently sway with beautiful subtlety and a nod to the historical Hymn. Here are\n21 tracks that breathe both; life and conflict, good and evil. This is simply an astounding, delightful collection of compositions from the original genius\nbehind the Talking Heads &amp; the Luaka Bop label.\nThis collection contains the first new songs from David Byrne since his 2004 release &quot;Grown Backwards.&quot;&quot;I had an idea to base my scoring loosely on\nMormon hymns. That would presumably hint at the unspoken spiritual underpinnings that motivate many of the characters' actions - or justify them,\nin some charactersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢' cases. I got hymnals and Mormon Hymns CDs, read up on the Mormon Church and began to practice writing 'fake' hymns.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e526e5fd2b5517044e312a4d12d8149b36f5493","amp;dn":"David+Byrne+-+Big+Love+Hymnal+%282008%29+%5Bmp3%40VBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e526e5fd2b5517044e312a4d12d8149b36f5493","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,82,110,95,210,181,81,112,68,227,18,164,209,45,129,73,179,111,84,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
