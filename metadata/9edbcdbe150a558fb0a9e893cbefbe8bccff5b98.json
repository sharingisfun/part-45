When she finds herself in an abusive relationship, this lesson serves her well. \n\nEight years later, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s settled back in her hometown and less fearful than sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever been in her life. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a first grade teacher, and with few friends and less family around, she has what she wants, a quiet life under the radar where she can be free of her past and live quietly. Until one night and one brutal act of violence changes everything. \n\nInjured and afraid, Sarah wants to run again, but Mark Summors refuses to let her go.\n\nMark was born and raised in Santa Rosa. He married his high school sweetheart and never questioned his life, until he found his wife with another man. Now divorced, he wants something more. He's passionate about his job, he wants to protect people, and he devotes his life to it. This time he's protecting more than just another client; he's protecting his future. At least, Sarah Jennings will be his future, once he convinces her she loves him.\n\nWhen Sarah agrees to let Mark help, she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t anticipate just how important of a role heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll play in her future or how the violence in her past will come back to threaten them both.\n\nPrecious Embrace (Embrace #2)\nby Dana Mason\n\n\nA second divorce and a new baby wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the vision Alison Hayes had for her future. Now a single mother with two young boys, she wants to focus on her kids and whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left of her stagnate career.\n\nWhen Detective Johnny Rhay Bennett breezes into her life with his country-boy accent, she wants to run. She doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need another man in her life, or another reason to make people talk. But when her worst nightmare becomes a reality, Johnny is the only person who can pull Ali out of her despair, forcing her to stay strong and not give up hope of finding her missing child.\n\n~~~\n\nWho falls in love after a one-night stand? Johnny Rhay doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible until it happens to him. With Nashville in his rear-view mirror, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined to convince Alison she loves him too, even if it means moving to the West Coast.\n\nAliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not easy, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s living on just this side of bitter after her divorce, but Johnny doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up for the challenge. At least, he believes heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up for it until baby Micah is stolen right out from under his nose. Now Johnny has to keep it together and get that sweet little boy home safe before his dreams of having a family vanish too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9edbcdbe150a558fb0a9e893cbefbe8bccff5b98","amp;dn":"Dana+Mason+Embrace+Series+1+%26amp%3B+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9edbcdbe150a558fb0a9e893cbefbe8bccff5b98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,219,205,190,21,10,85,143,176,169,232,147,203,239,190,139,204,255,91,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
