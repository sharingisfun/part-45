Taken from their third album, it reached number 19 in the UK singles chart. The song, inspired by the drudgery of having a &quot;9 to 5&quot; job in the modern world, is about not working oneself into an early grave. Bob Dylan's &quot;Maggie's Farm&quot; is also mentioned in the lyrics. The song samples the intro of &quot;Texas Never Whispers&quot; by Pavement.\n\nThe music video is directed by Howard Greenhalgh and was inspired by the movie Gattaca.\n\n( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_To_The_Wage )\n\n* Disc Information\n\nLabel: Elevator Music Ltd., Hut Recordings, Virgin\nCatalog#: FLOORCD12, 7243 897113 2 5, 7243 897113 2 5\nFormat: CD, Single\nCountry: UK\nReleased: 2000\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Alternative Rock \n\n* Tracklist\n\n\t* Disc 1\n\n01 - Slave To The Wage (Radio Edit) - 3:50\n\t* Producer, Mixed By - Paul Corkett\n\t* Written-by [Texas Never Whispers Sample] - Scott Kannberg , Stephen Malkmus\n02 - Leni - 4:40 \n\t* Producer, Mixed By - Paul Corkett\n03 - Bubblegum - 5:13 \t\n\t* Mixed By - Lorraine Francis\n \t* Producer - Dare Mason\n\n* Credits\n\nPhotography - Kevin Westenberg\nWritten By, Performer, Producer - Placebo\n\n* Notes\n\nTrack 1 contains a sample from Pavement's &quot;Texas Never Whispers&quot;.\n\nPublished by Famous Music Corporation (ASCAP)\nexcept track 1 Published by Famous Music Corporation (ASCAP)/EMI Music Publishing Ltd.\nThe copyright in this sound recording is owned by Virgin Records Ltd.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã¢â‚¬â€ &amp; Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2000 Virgin Records Ltd.\nPrinted/Made in the E.U.\nLC03098\nBarcode: 7 24389 71132 5\n\n* Technical Information\n\nEAC 0.99PreBeta5\nFLAC 1.2.1b (-V -5) | LAME 3.98.2 (-V 2 -q 0 -m j --noreplaygain) ~ 190kb/s\nTagged audio files with a non-compilant CUE sheet\nNo Artwork Included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:613c387d0d0dddce32e0c3b51ed51f59858c695b","amp;dn":"Placebo+-+Slave+To+The+Wage+%282000%29+%5BMP3%5D+%7BSingle%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"613c387d0d0dddce32e0c3b51ed51f59858c695b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,60,56,125,13,13,221,206,50,224,195,181,30,213,31,89,133,140,105,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
