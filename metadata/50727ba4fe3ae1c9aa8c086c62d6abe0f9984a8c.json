That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n=================================\n\n\nMad Magazine and assorted Mad material make up about 9 of 16gb in this torrent. MAD came out of  EC comics but DC took over publication in a year I'm too lazy too look up, so it's here.\nThe first 23 issues are actually comics (and had color)-this was before the comics code destroyed EC Comics. They saved Mad by destroying it and publishing something different under the same name. It was no longer all comics soit could be called a &quot;Magazine&quot; and so not subject to the &quot;comics&quot; code. I'm not saying it wasn't any good, just that it really wasn't the same thing. This change meant they could get distributed and sold w/o the code symbol, which distributors and retailers insisted on for comic. Defying the code was a practical proposition. \n\n\n=================================\n\nToday's offering:  DC from Ma-Mar\n\nWhile MAD is a big chunk here there are still quite a variety of other titles.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nMAD 01-xx (1952-20xx) 510 issues\n\nMAD Excerpts (Why not?)\n     A Kid's Guide to Bullshitting Your Way Through Life the George W.

I didn't know this was even scanned until recently. This is not all there is but it's taking awhile to gather and I didn't want to delay the torrent further for the rest of it. I'll put whatever else I can get in a fill torrent later. I a few of these are scans of the whole book, most are scans of just the new things. They are mostly pdf format because they were ripped (not by me) from a Mad CD set, and it was not worth my time to convert to cbr, in my opinion.\n\nMAD It's A Super-Spectacular Day!-mp3-Super Special Summer 1980.zip\nMAD Super Special 031 (Summer 1980).cbr\nMAD Super Special 031-Mystery Record-mp3.zip - This was a small vinyl disk included with the magazine.\nMAD Super Special 036 (Fall 1981).cbr\nMAD Super Special 101-MAD Sticks It to Comic Strips (01-1995).cbr\n\nSergio Aragones (Because he's so MAD)\n     Sergio Aragones Massacres Marvel.cbr\n     Sergio Aragones Stomps Star Wars.cbr\n\nMadame Xanadu v1 001 (DC(1981).cbr\nMadame Xanadu v2 01-29 (Vertigo(2008-2011)\nMadara v1 (Kadokawa Comic-scanlated-CMX substitute\nMagazineland USA-DC Marvel Giveaway (1977).cbr\nMagic Goes Away, The (1986).cbr\nMagnetic Men, The-Featuring Magneto (Amalgam(06-1997).cbr\nMagneto and the Magnetic Men (Amalgam(04-1996).cbr\nMagog 01-12 (2009-2010)\nMajestic TPB covers\nMajestic v1 01-04 (DC(2004-2005)\nMajestic v2 01-17 (Wildstorm(2005-2006)\nMajor Bummer 01-15 (1997-1998)\nThe Man Called A-X v1 01-05, 00 (Malibu-Bravura(1994-1995)\nThe Man Called A-X v1 Ashcan ctc (Malibu-Bravura(1994).cbr\nThe Man Called A-X v2 01-08 (DC(1997-1998)\nMan Called Kev, A -The Authority 01-05 (WS(2006-2007)\nMan of Rust 001-Superman Parody.cbr\nMan of Steel, The 01-06 (1986)\nThe Man of Steel TPB (1987).cbr\nThe Man of Steel TPB new material only (w alt cover)(1987).cbr\nMan-Bat\n     Man-Bat (1970-2006) Reference.zip\n     Man-Bat v1 01-02 (1975)\n     Man-Bat v2 001 (1984).cbr\n     Man-Bat v3 01-03 (1996)\n     Man-Bat v4 01-05 (2006)\n     Unpublished Man-Bat art-Brian Stelfreeze.cbr\nManhunter\n     Manhunter TPB covers\n     Manhunter v1 001 ctc (1984).cbr\n     Manhunter v2 01-24 (1988-1990)\n     Manhunter v3 0, 01-12 (1994-1995)\n     Manhunter v4 01-38 (2004-2009)\n     Manhunter-The Special Edition (1999).cbr\nManifest Eternity 01-06 (WS(2006)\nMany Loves of Dobie Gillis, The 01-26 (1960-1964)\nMany Worlds of Tesla Strong 001-2 covers (2003).cbr\nMars on Earth (Piranha-unscanned.jpg\nMartian Manhunter\n     Martian Manhunter Special 001 (1996).cbr\n     Martian Manhunter v1 01-04 (1988)\n     Martian Manhunter v2 00-36 (1998-2001)\n     Martian Manhunter v2 1,000,000 ctc (1998).cbr\n     Martian Manhunter v2 Annual 01-02 (1998-1999)\n     Martian Manhunter v3 01-08 (2006-2007)\n     Martian Manhunter-American Secrets 01-03 (1992)\nMarvel Family 01-89 (1945-1954)\nMarvel Family UK,CA FTH (for the heck of it)\n     The Marvel Family 048-Canadian edition (06-1950).cbr\n     The Marvel Family 064 (026) 32p B&amp;W (08-1948).cbr\n     The Marvel Family 074 (B&amp;W).cbr\nMarvel Treasury Edition 028-Featuring-Superman and Spiderman (1981).cbr\nMarvel and DC Present-The Uncanny X-Men and the New Teen Titans (07-1982).cbr\nMarvel vs DC-DC vs Marvel\n     DC versus Marvel-Marvel versus DC Consumer Preview (1995).cbr\n     DC vs Marvel-Marvel vs DC 001 (07-1996).cbr\n     DC vs Marvel-Marvel vs DC 004 (10-1996).cbr\n     Marvel vs DC-DC vs Marvel 002 (08-1996).cbr\n     Marvel vs DC-DC vs Marvel 003 (09-1996).cbr\n     Mary Marvel 01-28 (1945-1948)\n\n\n========================================================================\n\nFeel free to post this to other sites if you know how and are so inclined\n\n========================================================================\n\nPlease Seed!
