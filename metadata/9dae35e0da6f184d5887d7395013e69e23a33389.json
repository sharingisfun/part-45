Over the course of the twentieth century, partly in response to this crisis, a new language of loveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;intimacy&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½emerged, not so much replacing but rather coexisting with the earlier language of &quot;romance.&quot;\n\nReading a wide range of texts, from early twentieth-century advice columns and their late twentieth-century antecedent, the relationship self-help book, to Hollywood screwball comedies, and from the &quot;relationship films&quot; of Woody Allen and his successors to contemporary realist novels about marriages, Shumway argues that the kinds of stories the culture has told itself have changed. Part layperson's history of marriage and romance, part meditation on intimacy itself, Modern Love will be both amusing and interesting to almost anyone who thinks about relationships (and who doesn't?).
