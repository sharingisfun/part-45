And there is where my mind then goes to. To give some random attention to these (transition) songs (New Oldies) in between the two periods.\n\nAs a collector I have all kinds of queues, waiting to be emptied. All tracks claiming to be played (sometime). So I jumped in (Donald) and let basically let the music do its thing. It looks like becoming a series of 3 New Oldies. This one is the second.\n\nWarning: some songs come very close (to the heart).... Enjoy,\n\n\nDutch Treat - ^A169 Moving (New Oldies)\n\n01 Jimmy Nail - Love Don't Live Here Anymore\n02 A Fine Frenzy - Ashes And Wine\n03 Marike Jager - Easy\n04 Milow - Born In The Eighties\n05 Neneh Cherry - Woman\n06 Nicole Scherzinger - Baby Love\n07 The Script - We Cry\n08 Sting - Seven Days [Radio Edit]\n09 Corinne Bailey Rae - Put Your Records On\n10 Amos Lee - Baby I Want You\n11 Raul MidÃ‚Â¢n &amp; Stevie Wonder - Expressions Of Love\n12 Adele - Crazy For You\n13 Alain Clark - Your Angel Now\n14 Colbie Caillat &amp; Taylor Swift - Breathe\n15 Sting - Shape Of My Heart\n16 Macaco - Moving\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a908c91084a8806ef1930597f2e666736757a28","amp;dn":"VA%3A+New+Oldies+-+Moving+%28Dutch+Treat+%5EA169+HQ+VBR+MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a908c91084a8806ef1930597f2e666736757a28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,144,140,145,8,74,136,6,239,25,48,89,127,46,102,103,54,117,122,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
