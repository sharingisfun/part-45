As you know, the toolbar folder it the main concept for True Launch Bar. TLB saves all settings, shortcuts, menu etc. in the toolbar folder. By default TLB uses the standard quick launch folder and this is enough for the single toolbar. When you need the second toolbar, you have to create folder for the new toolbar. Now True Launch Bar can create the toolbar folder in your profile. Just type a name of your toolbar. This working for portable versions as well. Anyway you can still select any custom folder as a toolbar folder.\nNew True Launch Bar dialog box\nNew True Launch Bar\nCreate new toolobar\nCreate new toolobar\n\nImproved Components Manager for portable mode.\nNow you don't require to exit the portable Standalone TLB to check for updates.
