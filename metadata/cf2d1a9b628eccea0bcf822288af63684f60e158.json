What this means for you is you can make free unlimited calls to any phone in the US or Canada without using your voice minutes.\r\n\r\nGrooVe IP works on any android device, phone or tablet, and allows you to make calls using the deviceâ€™s data (WiFi or mobile data) connection. If you have a smartphone with Wi-Fi connectivity but no mobile plan, you can use this app to convert it to a free, full-featured working phone.\r\n\r\nThis app has a separate dialer that can be used to make calls. Alternatively, the native dialer, call-log, contacts, and favorite functionality can be shared between the phone and app on a call-by-call basis.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPlease ensure that your Google Voice account is associated with either a gmail or google apps account.\r\nTo receive incoming calls you MUST go into your Google Voice account and forward calls to Google Chat.\r\nGrooVe IP uses 1.2 MB per minute during a call\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's in this version: (Updated : 11 April 2016)\r\nIf you are having trouble with an update please try a clean install.
