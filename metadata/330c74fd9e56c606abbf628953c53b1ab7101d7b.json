However, he has to put the daydreaming aside when his charge, an oracular pig named Hen Wen, is kidnapped by an evil lord known as the Horned King. The villain hopes Hen will show him the way to The Black Cauldron, which has the power to create a giant army of unstoppable soldiers. With the aid of a stubborn princess, an exaggerating bard, and a pestering creature called Gurgi, Taran will try to save the world of Prydain from the Horned King. As the new friends face witches, elves, magic swords, and the Cauldron itself, Taran starts to learn what being a hero really means and that some things are more important than glory.\n\n----\n\nEncoded by: sickboy88\nCodec: XviD 1.1.0 Beta 2\nBitrate: 831 kb/s AVG\nAspect: 640x288 = 1.22:1\nAudio: English, 384 CBR 6 Ch AC3 @ 48K Hz\nSubtitles: External (Optional): English - VOBsub Format\nRuntime: 01:20:04\nFPS: 23.976\n\n----\n\nIf you are going to watch this, you'll want to install the NEW XviD codec:\n\nNow at Beta 2!\n\nhttp://www.koepi.org/XviD-1.1.0-Beta2-04042005.exe\n\nFor top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn\non (Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of\nXviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.\n\nIf you have a slow computer, please turn off pre-processing.
