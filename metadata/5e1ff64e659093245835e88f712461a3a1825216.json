During Eisner's years in the military, and particularly during the many field trips he made for P.S. Magazine, he observed camp life at close range. Some of the stories in this novel are comical, some heart-rending, some frightening, yet all display the incredible insight into humanity characteristic of Eisner's entire oeuvre. The first edition of this graphic novel features a full-color cover painted by the artist, with a matte and spot-gloss finish, interior cover flaps, and special sepia-colored ink printed on high-quality antique paper.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e1ff64e659093245835e88f712461a3a1825216","amp;dn":"Will+Eisner+-+Last+Day+In+Vietnam+%28A+Memory%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e1ff64e659093245835e88f712461a3a1825216","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,31,246,78,101,144,147,36,88,53,232,143,113,36,97,163,161,130,82,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
