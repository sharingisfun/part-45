Brighter 4:30\n\nRelease info:\n\nAtmospheric and visually charged throughout, it\\'s a seductive piece of work which grows on you with each listen.\nOrchid-Star\\'s debut, \\'Birth\\', released on Liquid Sound in 2008 along with \\'reBirth\\' - remixes by Youth, Tripswitch, Kuba, Subsonar and band leader Pete Ardron is regarded by many as a psychedelic chill classic.\nIts follow-up \\'Faster\\' retains all the trademarks of the first but is a significant progression. It still takes the listener to exotic, mysterious places but this time the live element, both instrumentally and vocally, and the personalities of those involved, are altogether more obvious. Living up to its name it is as much a treat to dance to as to listen - a joyful and passionate celebration of life and spirit. Psychedelic world-fusion - Indian, Irish, African, Latin, Middle Eastern, Balkan Gypsy driven by a mix of DnB, trance, progressive, funk, dub, ska with just the occasional downtempo groove, wrapped in a rich and vibrant orchestral-like production.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46a9b0750a7cfd7377a29f7e29363fa9c4f0aec8","amp;dn":"Orchid-Star+-+Faster+-+2011+%5BAmbient%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46a9b0750a7cfd7377a29f7e29363fa9c4f0aec8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,169,176,117,10,124,253,115,119,162,159,126,41,54,63,169,196,240,174,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
