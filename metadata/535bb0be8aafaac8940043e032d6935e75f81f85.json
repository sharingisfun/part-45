It's boisterous, exciting and fun, and makes you immediately think how great it would be to see this energetic music hybrid performed live.\n\nWith a voice that makes you wonder how vaudeville would have been if Jimmy Durante was a street punk, front man Torr Skoog barrels his gravelly vocals through each song, while Zack Brines hammers on the piano in a decidedly manic fashion. This alone could carry these guys, but the saxophones and washboard are pure icing. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Let It Burn\n02.King For A Day\n03.Other Side Of Hope\n04.Get Busy Livin' Or Get Busy Dyin'\n05.Playing The Fool\n06.Miss April\n07.King Of Nuthin'\n08.Boston Bound\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:535bb0be8aafaac8940043e032d6935e75f81f85","amp;dn":"The+Kings+Of+Nuthin%5C%27+-+Get+Busy+Livin%5C%27+%282001%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"535bb0be8aafaac8940043e032d6935e75f81f85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,91,176,190,138,175,170,200,148,0,67,224,50,214,147,94,117,248,31,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
