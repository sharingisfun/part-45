This transformation left him with a reptile's head, and a desire to find out the truth about who he really is. Accompanied by Nikaido, his female companion, he tracks down Magic Users in &quot;The Hole&quot; and unceremoniously chomps down on their head, hoping to find out who it was that put him in this state. One by one, they witness this &quot;second man&quot; inside the head of Kaiman, and after pulling them back out of his mouth he asks them all a question... &quot;What did the guy inside my head say?&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb46046731fcdd9345df51ef0c50f25dddc5c94d","amp;dn":"Hayashida+Q%3A+Dorohedoro%2C+18+volumes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb46046731fcdd9345df51ef0c50f25dddc5c94d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,70,4,103,49,252,221,147,69,223,81,239,12,80,242,93,221,197,201,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
