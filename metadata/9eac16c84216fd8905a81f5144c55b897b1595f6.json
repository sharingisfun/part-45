You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.\n\n--\nVersion 1.9.4 changes (11/21/2010):\n===================================\n* Added a new GRLDR version (Improves the ignore existing SLIC function)\n* Disabled table sorting by default for compatibility reasons\n* Added an option to disable type 3 memory as well as an option to reverse the SLIC search direction\n* Displays motherboard version to help with debugging\n* Added ECS, Dealin, Higrade and KSystems SLIC's\n* Added HCL, KSystems and MSI Home Basic serials\n* Added MSI Professional serial\n* Added Dealin Home Premium serial\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n--\n\nMD5: 230ffa6c55ada21c6490aa0495df7af0\nSHA-1: 9fc227f6d37a941578476da42561357ac165e067","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9eac16c84216fd8905a81f5144c55b897b1595f6","amp;dn":"Windows+Loader+v1.9.4+%28x86+x64%29+%2AMulti-lang%2A+By+DAZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9eac16c84216fd8905a81f5144c55b897b1595f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,172,22,200,66,22,253,137,5,168,31,81,68,197,91,137,123,21,149,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
