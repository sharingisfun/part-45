Narrated by actor and activist Sean Penn, the film exhumes remarkable archival footage of official distortion and exaggeration from LBJ to George W. Bush, revealing in stunning detail how the American news media have uncritically disseminated the pro-war messages of successive presidential administrations.\n\nThe film brings to the screen Norman Solomon's insightful analysis of the strategies used by administrations, both Democratic and Republican, to promote their agendas for war from Vietnam to Iraq. By familiarizing viewers with the techniques of war propaganda, &quot;War Made Easy&quot; encourages us to think critically about the messages put out by today's spin doctors - messages which are designed to promote and prolong a policy of militarism under the guise of the 'war on terror.' \n  \n\n\n\n\nNarrated by:  Sean Penn\n-----------------------\n\n\nDirected by: Loretta Alper &amp; Jeremy Earp\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTitle: War Made Easy: How Presidents &amp; Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death\nYear:  2007\nFile Size: 698 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 01:13:12\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 608x352\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1344 kbit/s\nFPS:  23.976023\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: (AC3)\nChannels:  2\nSubtitles: (External English)\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1015246/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1015246/&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\nNote: External English subtitle included.\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nFor father information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f064126b414c803c6391b581b3fb8b33032a3e4f","amp;dn":"War+Made+Easy-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f064126b414c803c6391b581b3fb8b33032a3e4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,100,18,107,65,76,128,60,99,145,181,129,179,251,139,51,3,42,62,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
