The band was completed with the addition of bassist Dani Evans and drummer Lorna Doone. Battleheart played their first\n\nlive show only five days after the members had all met together for the first time.\n\nA second EP was recorded the same year, with Evans now featuring in the recording line-up, although the drums were again programmed. Later in the\n\nyear, the song &quot;Set Sail And Conquer&quot; from the EP was featured on Metal Hammer's &quot;Battle Metal V&quot; CD with other such bands as TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â½r, Firewind,\n\nHammerFall and Blind Guardian.\n\n\n\nIn early 2007, drummer Doug Swierczek left the band for personal reasons, and was replaced by Ian Wilson of the band Catharist. Later in the year\n\nthe band changed their name to Alestorm after being signed by Napalm Records (though the announcements came in reverse order). The name change \n\nwas due to similarities with Battlelore, who were also signed to the label. Their debut album, &quot;Captain Morgan's Revenge&quot; was released in early\n\n2008. The song &quot;Captain Morgan's Revenge&quot; was also featured on &quot;Metal Hammer's Battle Metal VI&quot;.\n\nIn April 2008 the single Heavy Metal Pirates was released as a digital download. Ian Wilson left Alestorm in June of that year as he was unable \n\nto commit fully to the band, and he was temporarily replaced by German Alex Tabisz. However, Wilson rejoined the band in late August, in time for\n\na show at Ivory Blacks in Glasgow on August 29.\n\n\n\nIn September 2008, Bowes announced on Bloodstock's official forums that guitarist Gavin Harper had left the band due to &quot;[Harper] no longer\n\nhaving the enthusiasm for Alestorm that he once had&quot;. Additionally, Gavin posted on Alestorm's Myspace referring to his departure. Tim Shaw was\n\nannounced as Harper's replacement, but after a brief period of touring left the band. Dani Evans has since switched instruments from bass to \n\nguitar, and Gareth Murdock of Waylander has joined as the replacement bassist.\n\nIn late February 2009, after a second European support tour, the band embarked on the Pagan Knight's tour across North America with TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â½r and\n\nSuidakra.\n\n\n\nFrom April to May 2009, Alestorm, TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â½r, Heidevolk, and Adorned Brood took part in another European tour, titled &quot;Black Sails Over Europe&quot;. A tour\n\nCD was released by Napalm Records, containing new tracks from both Alestorm and TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â½r's new albums, along with four songs taken from both of \n\nHeidevolk's albums. Only 1,000 of these CDs were produced.\n\n\nCurrent members:\n\nChristopher Bowes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Lead Vocals; Keyboards (2004ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“present)\nDani Evans ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Lead Guitars; Backing Vocals (2008ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“present); Bass Guitars (2004ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2008)\nGareth Murdock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bass Guitars; Backing Vocals (2008ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“present)\nIan Wilson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Drums (2007ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2008, 2008ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“present)\n\n\n\nFormer members\n\nGavin Harper ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Lead Guitars; Backing Vocals (2004ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2008)\nTim Shaw ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Lead Guitars; Backing Vocals (2008)\nDoug Swierczek ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Drums (2004ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2007)\nAlex Tabisz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Drums (2008)\nGraham Hardburn - Gutair (2008)\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n\nCaptain Morgan's Revenge (2008)\nBlack Sails at Midnight (2009)\n\n\nEPs/Demos/Singles\n\nBattleheart (EP) (2006)\nTerror on the High Seas (EP) (2006)\nHeavy Metal Pirates (Single) (2008) (That song is included in the Battleheart EP)\nLeviathan (EP) (2008)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fd3f928ab5fd55755aef76d35174f658b01ce95","amp;dn":"Alestorm+%2B+Battleheart+Discography+%28MOST+COMPREHENSIVE%21%29+%5BEPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fd3f928ab5fd55755aef76d35174f658b01ce95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,211,249,40,171,95,213,87,85,174,247,109,53,23,79,101,139,1,206,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
