The title of the track he created is &amp;#039;Global Harmony&amp;#039;.\n\nThe collaboration is based on the contribution of Chinese visual artist Xiao Xue who designed a new limited-edition Coca-Cola bottle. The graphic arts featured in the design, were then united with TiÃƒÂ«sto&amp;#039;s track, thus showing the basis of the concept: the possibilities that emerge when cultures of all parts of the world come together.\n\nBoth the artistic and cultural exchange of this first ever project resulted in a total of eight limited-edition aluminum contour bottles by the title &amp;#039;WE8&amp;#039;, which refers to the collaboration between West and East around eight different themes.
