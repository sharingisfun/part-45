Because I know how powerful this platform is in establishing positive relationships between the artist and his audience.\n\nI believe that we need to share more, not less, and I hope to continue the tradition of authors like Paulo Coelho, a true friend of our community.\n\nIt's extremely difficult to make money out of written works these days. What I hope is to generate some fans so that I can continue producing longer works.\n\nFile sharing and free speech is under immense attack. Instead of banning websites, it would be much better if content creators realised the positive effect of exposure and free publicity p2p campaigns bring.\n\nI see no better example than the recent film The Tunnel, which saw its first release on torrent websites. The exposure generated by this move has allowed the makers of The Tunnel to keep producing wonderful content.\n\nI hope you enjoy reading A Short Walk into the Sun.\n\n\nBen\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb2cb8e7fb6f7074e0257455389fe419f668a280","amp;dn":"A+Short+Walk+into+the+Sun+2012+ebook+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb2cb8e7fb6f7074e0257455389fe419f668a280","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,44,184,231,251,111,112,116,224,37,116,85,56,159,228,25,246,104,162,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
