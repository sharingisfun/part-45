We pre'd these       |\n  |   titles just as we do anything else we put out and just because your   |\n  |   shitty sites and/or bots didn't pick them up until August is no       |\n  |   reason be an idiot. The release dates are clearly marked in the       |\n  |   nfo. You nukers are capable of reading, right?                        |\n  |                                                                         |\n  |   Furthermore we'd like to educate everyone on the intricacies of the   |\n  |   platform for a bit. Inside the header of each .nds file is a value    |\n  |   called 'rom_size'. All of the vital game data exists between the      |\n  |   start of the file and until the offset specified in 'rom_size'. The   |\n  |   rest of the file is comprised of padding to fill up the size of the   |\n  |   ROM chip, and this data is of entirely no consequence. Our release    |\n  |   of Ice Age 3 had some portion of this padding that was corrupt, and   |\n  |   someone started spreading the notion that it was somehow a bad        |\n  |   dump. This data is never accessed. It doesn't matter what's there.    |\n  |   Does the release play without crashing on every hardware out there?   |\n  |   Yes it does. No one out there will play our release and have it       |\n  |   crash due to this data. Once a release is unplayable due to corrupt   |\n  |   data, then you may call it a 'bad dump'. This is not one of those     |\n  |   cases.                                                                |\n  |                                                                         |\n  |   Your inclination to nuke anything that is different from the de       |\n  |   facto standard just shows your lack of understanding of the           |\n  |   platform. See, for example, attempts by our knowledgeable friends     |\n  |   in SQUiRE to bring some true innovation and only get shot down        |\n  |   because someone who doesn't understand what's happening has access    |\n  |   to 'site nuke'.                                                       |\n  |                                                                         |\n  |   I say true innovation here because it shows a proper understanding    |\n  |   of the platform they're releasing for. That filesystem compression    |\n  |   was truly elite, kudos to you. Not like this crap BAHAMUT puts out    |\n  |   and pats themselves on the back for being 'innovative', when in       |\n  |   fact their work is entirely useless. Sticking a hybrid title into a   |\n  |   DS and running a dumper on it? That's some radical innovation for     |\n  |   sure. Why didn't anyone else think of this? However, just like an     |\n  |   eager teenager on prom night you're blowing your load too early.      |\n  |                                                                         |\n  |   Your DSiWare releases were encrypted and tied to a specific           |\n  |   console, just like WiiWare is when you export it to an SD card.       |\n  |   Your dumps of hybrid titles are entirely fucked as well. It didn't    |\n  |   strike you as odd that the same 0x1000 bytes kept repeating over      |\n  |   and over at the offset where the DSi specific binaries start? Of      |\n  |   course, you lack the TWL additions to the header to even *have*       |\n  |   these offsets, so it's not very surprising. All of which points       |\n  |   towards a lack of tact and understanding of the platform itself.      |\n  |                                                                         |\n  |   It's truly a shame that the scene is like this today. The loud and    |\n  |   ignorant opinion gets taken as fact only because it's loud. It's      |\n  |   all about padding your numbered collection of 100% untouched dumps,   |\n  |   and if that's all you're about then all we have for you is a good     |\n  |   hearty 'fuck you'. That's not what the scene is about. It's not       |\n  |   what the scene was *ever* about. Having a catalogue of software       |\n  |   titles isn't the end goal, it's a side effect. The scene is about     |\n  |   showing off technical skill, about oneupmanship, about friendly       |\n  |   (and in some cases not so friendly) rivalry. If you're not            |\n  |   producing something that cultivates this ethos, then you're not a     |\n  |   scener. Make chiptunes, code intros, crack some protections! This     |\n  |   is what it's about. Participate. Produce something of your own.       |\n  |                                                                         |\n  |   Don't just replicate and collect with no interest in how things       |\n  |   work. Why should your opinion matter when you're not even             |\n  |   interested in what the platform can do or how it works?               |\n  |                                                                         |\n  |   Phew, this was supposed to be a short note about the recent           |\n  |   silliness and turned into a paragraphs long rant.
