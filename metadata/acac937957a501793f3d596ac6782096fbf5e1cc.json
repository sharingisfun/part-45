Rubsam's playing combines the finest aspects of his teachers, Helmut Walcha (discipline and total integrity) and Marie-Claire Alain (subtle nuance and rythmic verve). \n\nIn Rubsam's more recent Bach cycle (on the budget-priced Naxos label) you'll enjoy a greater variety of historic and modern instruments, but the artist's interpretations are somewhat more individualistic, even provocative, still arresting if not quite main-stream.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acac937957a501793f3d596ac6782096fbf5e1cc","amp;dn":"Bach+-+Organ+Works+-+Wolfgang+Rubsam+%28Phillips+16+CDs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acac937957a501793f3d596ac6782096fbf5e1cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,172,147,121,87,165,1,121,63,61,89,106,198,120,32,150,251,245,225,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
