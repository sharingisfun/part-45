This file is\n  included in the &quot;data&quot; folder indexed by this torrent. With a modern\n  BitTorrent client, you can adjust the priority to download this file first.\n\n  Once you have the datfile, verify and fix your collection with the ClrMamePro\n  tool. On the net, there are many good guides on how to use this tool\n  correctly (also see the guide referenced below). For this step, it's better to\n  keep your rom sets unmerged and in zip format. Don't forget to make backups of\n  your files just in case!\n\n  Once you have fixed your previous files, you just need to torrentzip all of\n  them, so they match the files from this torrent. A good general guide about\n  clrmamepro and torrentzip can be found at [4].\n\n  Now you're ready to start updating/sharing your collection efficiently. Place\n  your torrentzip'ed files where your BitTorrent client expects them, force a\n  re-check of the files and your torrent will be joined with all your previous\n  files. Have fun, and seed generously :). Thanks.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n[1] http://www.no-intro.org/\n[2] http://sourceforge.net/projects/trrntzip/\n[3] http://mamedev.emulab.it/clrmamepro/\n[4] http://mametitles.co.uk/tz/torrentzip.pdf\n\nOther collections available\n---------------------------\n\n* Nintendo Game Boy\n* Nintendo Game Boy Color\n* Nintendo Entertainment System\n* Super Nintendo Entertainment System\n* Nintendo 64","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2b786809ba41771fb1c0efd64b120d8696c62ef","amp;dn":"FGC%3A+Nintendo+Game+Boy+Advance+ROMs+-+No-Intro+2012-01-27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2b786809ba41771fb1c0efd64b120d8696c62ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,183,134,128,155,164,23,113,251,28,14,253,100,177,32,216,105,108,98,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
