A Vinyasa-style yoga class, focus is on the core and shoulders as well as strength exercises and inversions.\n\nFlow from one challenging pose into the next in this Andrea Jensen led class, as each pose prepares you for the &quot;journey into full forearm balance,&quot; also known as pincha mayurasana, or Feathered Peacock Pose. This pose requires complete concentration as well as patience and balance, and while it puts absolutely no pressure on the head, it features all the fantastic benefits of being upside down.\n\nRemember that when learning pincha mayurasana, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not uncommon to fall, which is why learning how to &quot;tuck and roll&quot; is also important. Build strength in the arms, back, and shoulders as you calm the mind and release it from the tension of daily stress. Join Andrea and challenge yourself today!\n\nLevel: Advanced\nStyle: Vinyasa\nFocus: Core, Shoulders, Inversions, Strength\n\nVideo; x264; 1280*720 (16:9); 1818 kbps; 23.976 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b51c088f90da91a17e3c825756ba49f887c901d","amp;dn":"Andrea+Jensen+Yoga+-+Forearm+Balance+Prep+30+min+x264+aac+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b51c088f90da91a17e3c825756ba49f887c901d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,81,192,136,249,13,169,26,23,227,200,37,117,107,164,159,136,124,144,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
