Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, he was engaged as a court musician in Salzburg, but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position, always composing abundantly. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized. He was survived by his wife Constanze and two sons.\n\nMozart learned voraciously from others, and developed a brilliance and maturity of style that encompassed the light and graceful along with the dark and passionate. He composed over 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence on subsequent Western art music is profound; Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote that &quot;posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Croce-Mozart-Detail.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Croce-Mozart-Detail.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46613ccac33428c384fe61780194cc1abef98d96","amp;dn":"The+Best+of+Mozart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46613ccac33428c384fe61780194cc1abef98d96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,97,60,202,195,52,40,195,132,254,97,120,1,148,204,26,190,249,141,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
