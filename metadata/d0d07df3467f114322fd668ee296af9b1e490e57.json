The song was written by Andrew Farriss and Michael Hutchence and is one of INXS's best known songs.\n\nIt was released as a single in February 1988. The song is well remembered for its catchy riff and Michael Hutchence's whisper of the lyrics.\n\nThe song went to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, #47 in the United Kingdom, #20 in France, #25 in Ireland and #6 in Australia.\n\nGuitarist and saxophone player Kirk Pengilly stated in an interview that he did not like the music video for &quot;Devil Inside,&quot; because he thought that it was &quot;too American.&quot;\n\nThe video was filmed in Balboa, California and directed by Joel Schumacher.\n\nINXS (pronounced &quot;in excess&quot;) is an Australian rock and New Wave band, formed as The Farriss Brothers in 1977 in Sydney. Mainstays are Garry Gary Beers on bass, Andrew Farriss on keyboards, Jon Farriss on drums, Tim Farriss on lead guitar and Kirk Pengilly on guitar/sax. For twenty years they were fronted by Michael Hutchence on lead vocals, whose &quot;sultry good looks&quot; and magnetic stage presence made him the focal point of the band. Initially known for their New Wave/ska/pop style, they later developed a harder pub rock style, including funk and dance elements.\n\nINXS has won six Australian Recording Industry Association awards including three for 'Best Group' in 1987, 1989 and 1992, and was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2001. To date INXS have sold more than 30 million records.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_Inside_(INXS_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_Inside_(INXS_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AaEIBAAdh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AaEIBAAdh&lt;/a&gt;\n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6700kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:05:12\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
