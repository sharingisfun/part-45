Extract the L1011-setup basepack (which includes a few liveries) to a folder of your choice.\n\n2.click the set-up exe and follow the instructions, making sure you install into the main FSX folder, where ever that is on your computer.\n\n3. Once installed the basepack that is go to the freetextureset folder and do the same as above, I think there are about 90 texture sets all up and they look great.\n\nNotes\nTHis model is one of the best FDEs around, flies like the real thing, a heavie! The downside is the Taxi part, getting the thing to the take-off runway. Put simply, its a bastard to taxi without cutting the grass a few times along the way. Having said that it can be mastered, HINT not much throttle and lots of rudder movements to steer the thing on the ground, and slow down to turn but don&amp;#039;t stop when in a turn!!!!! goes great in a straight line, if you can get it lined up....LOL\n\n\nIf you like it, buy it thats what I did, thanks to TPB!\n\nI think I got this upload right\n\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7b7b746f15e62196c4d94bd8fdad6234ac3bb5e","amp;dn":"FSX_PF_Tri-star","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7b7b746f15e62196c4d94bd8fdad6234ac3bb5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,183,183,70,241,94,98,25,108,77,148,189,143,218,214,35,74,195,187,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
