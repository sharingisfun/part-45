I can't seem to figure out why.. But at the least, it works on firefox with flash 11.2 (haven't tested much else).. Or you can download the stand-alone flash-projector thing and I think it should work with that if nothing else..\n\nWhat has been changed from the original:\n\n- Can play it locally from your hard-drive\n\n- Can play it even with an old flash version (which means linux users can play it)\n\n- Premium mode is enabled, so you have access to all skills, and also endurance mode\n\nEndurance mode makes the game really easy though, so you might want to avoid using it unless you are stuck..\n\nI fixed the problem that my earlier revision had, where local games would not save.. I have fixed that now I believe, and I've tested it and they save for me now.. So it should work for every one now I hope..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9578221ce21719d2926ce40ab2e59f1d96e9898e","amp;dn":"Gemcraft+2+Chasing+Shadows+v1.0.12+Cracked_Rev.2+Works+on+Linux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9578221ce21719d2926ce40ab2e59f1d96e9898e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,120,34,28,226,23,25,210,146,108,228,10,178,229,159,29,150,233,137,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
