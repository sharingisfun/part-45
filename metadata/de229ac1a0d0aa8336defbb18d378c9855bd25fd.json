Debuting with 1984's No Kinda Dancer, the Houston native has recorded 18 full-length albums for both independent and major record labels, while his songs have also been covered by several different artists from the country, folk and Texas country music scenes (including George Strait, Joe Ely, Lyle Lovett, The Highwaymen, Nanci Griffith, and the Dixie Chicks). \n\n\nA Bigger Piece of Sky is frequently cited to be one of Keen's best if not the best and is considered to be a transitional point in his career as an artist.\n \nThe album brings together various elements of alternative country such as roots-rock, honky tonk, and folk to form Keen's own cohesive blend of Texas music. Reviewers cite &quot;Corpus Christi Bay&quot;, &quot;Whenever Kindness Fails&quot;, &quot;So I Can Take My Rest&quot;, and &quot;Paint the Town Beige&quot; as stand-out tracks. Keen's down-beat duet with Irish singer Maura O'Connell, &quot;Night Right for Love&quot; is also worthy of note as is Keen's cover of Terry Allen's &quot;Amarillo Highway&quot;. Other guest performers include Marty Stuart on mandolin and Garry Tallent on electric and upright bass.\n\n\n01. &quot;Amarillo Highway&quot; (Allen) 2:26 \n02. &quot;Corpus Christi Bay&quot;   3:58 \n03. &quot;Whenever Kindness Fails&quot;   3:35 \n04. &quot;Blow You Away&quot;   3:35 \n05. &quot;Jesse With the Long Hair Hanging Down&quot;   3:46 \n06. &quot;Night Right for Love&quot; (Keen, Trooper) 4:16 \n07. &quot;Paint The Town Beige&quot;   4:33 \n08. &quot;Daddy Had a Buick&quot;   2:57 \n09. &quot;Crazy Cowboy Dream&quot;   2:27 \n10. &quot;Here in Arkansas&quot;   4:45 \n11. &quot;So I Can Take My Rest&quot;   3:21 \n12. &quot;Blow You Away&quot; (reprise) \n\n\nIf you like the music, buy it!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de229ac1a0d0aa8336defbb18d378c9855bd25fd","amp;dn":"Robert+Earl+Keen+-+A+Bigger+Piece+of+Sky+%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de229ac1a0d0aa8336defbb18d378c9855bd25fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,34,154,193,160,208,170,131,54,222,251,177,141,55,140,152,85,189,37,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
