It originally commenced transmissions as an offshore radio station broadcasting from a ship anchored in international waters off the coast of South East England. Originally unlicensed by any government, for the majority of its early life, it was labelled as a pirate radio station.\n\nThe station continues today as a satellite and internet broadcaster, with occasional transmissions via a low power Restricted Service Licence, usually emanating from the final offshore ship, the MV Ross Revenge. Music ranging from the 1960s to today is broadcast, with an emphasis on album-oriented rock (AOR) but also &quot;mixing things up&quot; with nostalgic tracks and some specialised music programmes.\n\nThe British government responded to the burgeoning popularity of Caroline and the other offshore stations in 1967 by passing the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act, which made it an offence to advertise or supply an offshore radio station from the UK. However, a rearguard action was attempted by the Manx parliament Tynwald to exclude the North Ship from the legislation with an appeal to the European Court on the legality of the act being applied to the Isle of Man. All offshore stations off the British coast closed, with the exception of Radio Caroline, which moved its supply operation to the Netherlands, where national laws had not made unlicensed offshore broadcasting a criminal offence.\n\nRadio Caroline's original disc jockeys were Simon Dee, Chris Moore, Donny Kerr, Tom Lodge, Gerry Duncan and Carl Conway. They were later joined by Dave Lee Travis, Emperor Rosko, Tony Blackburn, Colin Berry, Tony Prince, Bob Stewart, Tommy Vance and also Johnnie Walker and Roger Day who moved from Radio England. Andy Archer moved there, from Radio City, as did Tony Allan and Steve Merike who came from Radio Scotland.\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\t\n01.Cat Stevens - Bad Night  (1967 Deram DM140 DM)\n02.The Flower Pot Men - A Walk In The Sky (1967 Deram DM160 DM)\n03.The Flower Pot Men - Am I Losing You (1967 Deram DM160)\n04.Falling Leaves - Beggars Parade (1966 Decca F12420 DM)\n05.Johnny Young - Craise Finton Kirk (1967 Polydor 56186 DM)\n06.Fairport Convention - Crazy Man Michael  (1969 Island ILP 9115 DM)\n07.Spirit - Dark Eyed Woman (1968 CBS S4511 DM)\n08.Hedgehoppers Anonymous - Daytime (1966 Decca F12479 DM)\nRadiophonics Workshop - Doctor Who  (1964 Decca F11837 DM)\n10.Fairport Convention - Farewell Farewell  (1969 Island ILP 9115 DM)\n11.Johnny Young - I Am The World  (1967 Polydor 56186 DM)\n12.Spirit - Ice (1968 CBS S4511 DM)\n13.Fairport Convention - Meet On The Ledge (1968 Island WIP-6047-A)\n14.The Incredible String Band - No Sleep Blues  (1967 Elektra EKSN45028 SM44-M)\n15.The Incredible String Band - Painting Box  (1967 Elektra EKSN45028 SM44-M)\n16.Hedgehoppers Anonymous - That's The Time  (1966 Decca F12479 DM)\n17.Cat Stevens - Laughing Apple  (1967 Deram DM140 DM)\n18.Brenda And Johnny - This Can't Be Love  (1964 Decca F11837 DM)\n19.Fairport Convention - Throwaway Street Puzzle (1968 Island WIP-6047-B)\n20.Falling Leaves - Tomorrow Night  (1966 Decca F12420 DM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9f9b0ac8111e6cac94a3f8548e780fbaf5930be","amp;dn":"VA+-+Radio+Caroline+Pirate+Radio+60%5C%27s+7%5C%22+Singles+%282011%29+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9f9b0ac8111e6cac94a3f8548e780fbaf5930be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,249,176,172,129,17,230,202,201,74,63,133,72,231,128,251,175,89,48,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
