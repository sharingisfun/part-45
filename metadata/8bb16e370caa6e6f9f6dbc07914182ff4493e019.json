Grumezescu (WA, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nNanobiomaterials in Cancer Therapy presents the major applications of nanobiomaterials in oncology, offering an up-to-date overview of the latest research in this field. Utilizing nanobiomaterials, novel therapeutic approaches enable significant improvements in drug-loading capacity, formulation stability and drug efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn this book, leading researchers from around the world share their expertise and unique insights. The book covers the fabrication methods of platforms for multimodal and combinatorial therapeutic options, along with simultaneous and real-time cancer imaging, and innovative approaches for oncology by passive or active pathways of multifunctional nanocarriers. The work also classifies and discusses engineered nanobiosystems for cancer therapy, prevention, and low cancer recurrence or relapse.\r\n\r\nThis book will be of interest to postdoctoral researchers, professors and students engaged in the fields of materials science, biotechnology and applied chemistry. It will also be highly valuable to those working in industry, including pharmaceutics and biotechnology companies, medical researchers, biomedical engineers and advanced clinicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA comprehensive resource for researchers, practitioners and students working in biomedical, biotechnological and engineering fields.\r\nA valuable guide to recent scientific progress and the latest application methods.\r\nDiscusses novel opportunities and ideas for developing or improving technologies in nanomedicine and nanobiology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bb16e370caa6e6f9f6dbc07914182ff4493e019","amp;dn":"Nanobiomaterials+in+Cancer+Therapy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bb16e370caa6e6f9f6dbc07914182ff4493e019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,177,110,55,12,170,110,111,159,109,188,7,145,65,130,255,68,147,224,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
