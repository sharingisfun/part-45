Never a critics' favorite, the quartet from Fort Payne, Alabama, presents slick, sentimental songs that unerringly catch the ear of fans yet mystify those who don't hear the appeal. This two-CD career retrospective, which presents all 41 of the group's No. 1 hits, underlines just how successful they've been. The strengths are there: Randy Owen's clear, deep, intimate vocals; the focus on accessible melodies and musical hooks; and the straightforward song sense that plainly celebrates love, family, and home with all the simplicity of homilies stitched into a framed kitchen doily. Some might argue about Alabama's artistic value, but the band's 18-year track record offers a convincing retort.\n\nAlabama\nFor The Record (1998)\n2 x CD's @ 320 kbps + all covers\nApprox 353.4Mb\n\nDisc: 1\n01 Five O'Clock 500 - (previously unreleased)\n02 Keepin' Up - (previously unreleased)  \n03 How Do You Fall In Love - (previously unreleased)\n04 Tennessee River  \n05 Why Lady Why  \n06 Old Flame     \n07 Feels So Right    \n08 Love in the First Degree     \n09 Mountain Music    \n10 Take Me Down   \n11 Close Enough to Perfect   \n12 Dixieland Delight     \n13 The Closer You Get    \n14 Lady Down on Love     \n15 Roll On (Eighteen Wheeler)     \n16 When We Make Love    \n17 If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)    \n18 (There's A) Fire in the Night    \n19 There's No Way     \n20 Forty Hour Week (For a Livin')     \n21 Can't Keep a Good Man Down     \n22 She and I     \n\nDisc: 2\n01 Touch Me When We're Dancing\n02 You've Got the Touch  \n03 Face to Face \n04 Fallin' Again  \n05 Song of the South  \n06 If I Had You     \n07 High Cotton     \n08 Southern Star     \n09 Jukebox in My Mind    \n10 Forever's as Far as I'll Go     \n11 Down Home     \n12 Here We Are     \n13 Then Again     \n14 Born Country     \n15 I'm in a Hurry (And Don't Know Why)     \n16 Once Upon a Lifetime     \n17 Hometown Honeymoon     \n18 Reckless     \n19 Give Me One More Shot     \n20 She Ain't Your Ordinary Girl     \n21 In Pictures     \n22 Sad Lookin' Moon  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e88838a1f5058d277b20bbdff6f5b272fc4fbdfb","amp;dn":"Alabama+-+For+The+Record+%281998%29+2CD+%40+320+++all+covers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e88838a1f5058d277b20bbdff6f5b272fc4fbdfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,136,56,161,245,5,141,39,123,32,187,223,246,245,178,114,252,79,189,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
