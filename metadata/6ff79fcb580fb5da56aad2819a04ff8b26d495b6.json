New observations from ground- and space-based telescopes, the discovery of dark matter, and new insights into its distribution have been instrumental in this. This textbook provides graduate students with a modern introduction to the gravitationally-determined structure and evolution of galaxies. Readers will also benefit from detailed discussions of the issues involved in the process of modeling complex stellar systems. Additionally, the text provides an accessible framework for interpreting observations and devising new observational tests. Based on the author's extensive teaching experience, this Second Edition features an up to date view of basic phenomenology, a discussion of the structure of dark halos in galaxies, the dynamics of quasi-relaxed stellar systems and globular clusters, galaxies and gravitational lensing and an introduction to self-gravitating accretion disks.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface to the First Edition, 2000 page xiii\nPreface to the Second Edition xv\nAcknowledgments xvii\nPART I BASIC PHENOMENOLOGY 1\n1 Scales 3\n2 Observational Windows 9\n3 Classifications 19\n4 Photometry, Kinematics, and Dark Matter 29\n5 Basic Questions, Semi-empirical Approach, and the Dynamical Window 53\nPART II PHYSICAL MODELS 59\n6 Self-Gravity and Relation to Plasma Physics 61\n7 Relaxation Times, Absence of Thermodynamical Equilibrium 66\n8 Models 82\n9 Equilibrium and Stability: Symmetry and Symmetry Breaking 95\n10 Classical Ellipsoids 105\n11 Introduction to Dispersive Waves 119\n12 Jeans Instability 131\nPART III SPIRAL GALAXIES 141\n13 Orbits 143\n14 The Basic State: Vertical and Horizontal Equilibrium of the Disk 162\n15 Density Waves 184\n16 Roles of Gas 210\n17 Global Spiral Modes 229\n18 Spiral Structure in Galaxies 247\n19 Bending Waves 266\n20 Dark Matter in Spiral Galaxies 280\nPART IV ELLIPTICAL GALAXIES 297\n21 Orbits 299\n22 Stellar Dynamical Models 313\n23 Stability 355\n24 Dark Matter in Elliptical Galaxies 370\nPART V IN PERSPECTIVE 389\n25 Selected Aspects of Formation and Evolution 391\n26 Galaxies and Gravitational Lensing 418\n27 Self-Gravitating Accretion Disks 435\nBibliography 451\nIndex 455","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ff79fcb580fb5da56aad2819a04ff8b26d495b6","amp;dn":"Dynamics+of+Galaxies+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ff79fcb580fb5da56aad2819a04ff8b26d495b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,247,159,203,88,15,181,218,86,170,210,129,154,4,255,139,38,212,149,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
