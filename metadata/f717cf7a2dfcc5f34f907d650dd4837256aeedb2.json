The party is back and bigger than ever in the Mario Party 9 game for Wii, featuring all-new ways to play! For the first time in the franchise, boss battles crash the party and challenge players to compete to defeat a common enemy. In addition, players now travel across stages together in a vehicle towards a common goal - overcoming obstacles, battling bosses, and collecting Mini Stars stolen by Bowser and his minions. Featuring 80 new minigames, adventurous new stages, and all-new ways to play that blend cooperative and competitive action for up to four players, Mario Party 9 is the perfect way to get the party started. No time to play through an entire stage? New minigame modes let players enjoy the action in smaller chunks of time. They can hone their skills at any minigame in Free Play mode or try the Extras mode that includes Goomba Bowling and the puzzle-based Castle Clear out.\n                  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f717cf7a2dfcc5f34f907d650dd4837256aeedb2","amp;dn":"Mario+Party+9+NTSC+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f717cf7a2dfcc5f34f907d650dd4837256aeedb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,23,207,122,45,252,197,243,79,144,125,101,13,212,131,114,86,174,237,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
