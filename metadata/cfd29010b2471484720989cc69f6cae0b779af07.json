It is a journal written by patients for patients, and has grown into a world wide source of information.\n\nTY provides patients and care givers the information on where they can acquire seeds, to different methods of growing medical marijuana for themselves and introducing healthier methods of taking their medicine.\n\nOur website treatingyourself.com is the largest and most compassionate medical marijuana website to date. TY is a predominately ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmedical marijuanaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ website whose goal it is to provide the education in the responsible use of marijuana as it applies to medicine, and to consolidate as many ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpro marijuanaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ websites and interest groups with a goal to co-ordinate all of our efforts with regards to the issues of legalization.\n\nTeam TY would like to welcome all respectable, responsible marijuana users. We would like to see a concerted effort on behalf of all respectable, responsible marijuana users World Wide, helping in the effort to abolish prohibition as prohibition must be abolished! As individual ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œinterest groupsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ we are at the mercy and whim of the governing bodies of the world, however if we were to unite and begin to demonstrate to the world that we are responsible and respectable members of society the choice will be clear. Marijuana must be made fully legal to any and all who have obtained the age of majority!\n\nThe time has come for our governments and lawmakers World Wide to abolish the immoral prohibition of an innocuous flower! The time has come to realize that we are not ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpotheadsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstonersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, far from it! We are tax payers; we go to work every day we are employed in every walk of life. People who use marijuana range from janitors to judges, barbers to doctorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ yes even a good number of our police use marijuana!\n\nYet the facts remain the sameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ we still face prohibition, we are still unjustly locked up, we can still have our lives ruined! All because the propaganda machine is kept well oiled and fine tuned. It is our duty to throw sand in those gears! It is our duty to dismantle this ponderous loathsome machine! The only way to achieve this is to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwalk the walkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtalk the talkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ the marijuana consumers of the world must show the lawmakers that we do NOT cause harm, we are responsible, we are respectable and we are valued, productive members of society!\n\nIt is long past due that we remove the stigma that is attached to marijuana, to date there are hundreds of legal marijuana users in Canada who would rather that the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpublicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ not know who they are. Not for fear of being ripped offÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ noÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ They would rather remain anonymous because society has allowed the stigmatism of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpotheadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstonerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to continue. They would rather remain anonymous because they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to be harassed by police for their legal gardensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want their professional careers to be interfered with. All they really want is to be allowed to live a more pain free productive life! There are literally hundreds of thousands more that use marijuana as a relaxant to help manage stress, stress kills!\n\nEven for the social user marijuana is used at parties and other gatherings, much in the same way that alcohol is usedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ with far less addicting effects and without the morning after hangover. Marijuana is of course among the most benign of the so called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œparty drugsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, far greater threats can be found in the form of crack cocaine and crystal meth!\n\nTo suggest that the ingesting of a plant such as marijuana should also carry with it the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œshameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of a criminal record and the possible destruction of any future career opportunity or even the ability to freely travel about the globe.. Is in fact a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œshameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcrimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ against the responsible and respectable marijuana consumers of the world!\n\nWe must legalize marijuana! We must remove the criminal element from marijuana, to do this it must be legal for anyone to grow and use marijuana that is at or above the age of consent! By removing the archaic laws that continue to prohibit the free use of this wondrous herb we would free up multiple billions of dollars currently being eaten up by police agencies around the globe in an effort to stamp out a relatively harmless plant!\n\nBy doing so our fine police officers would be able to concentrate on ending the threat of far more dangerous and insidious addictive drugs such as crack cocaine and methamphetamines. There is a better way! The government needs to hear your voices! Send your thoughts to your local MP or Government representative; do not be afraid, only criminals need to be afraid!\n\nYou are simply pursuing your rights! The future is in your hands, shape it wisely ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ someday your health may hang in the balance!\n\nTeam TY and all of the members of TreatingYourself.com, wish you good health and good grows.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfd29010b2471484720989cc69f6cae0b779af07","amp;dn":"Treating+Yourself+%28Issue+19%29+Medical+Marijuana+Growing+Journal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfd29010b2471484720989cc69f6cae0b779af07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,210,144,16,178,71,20,132,114,9,137,204,105,246,202,224,183,121,175,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
