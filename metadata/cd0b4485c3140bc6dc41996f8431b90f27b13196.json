The band's influence widened considerably with 1999's Clarity -- an album that has since emerged as a landmark of the emo genre -- it was the band's follow-up (specifically the infectious single &quot;The Middle&quot;) that crowned them as major figures in commercial rock. The emo label proved difficult to shake throughout the 2000s, even when subsequent albums like Futures and Chase This Light did little to evoke the hard-edged sensitivity of Clarity, but Jimmy Eat World still remained a league above the generation of emocore torch-bearers they helped spawn.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd0b4485c3140bc6dc41996f8431b90f27b13196","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Eat+World+-+Damage+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd0b4485c3140bc6dc41996f8431b90f27b13196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,11,68,133,195,20,11,198,220,65,153,111,132,49,185,15,39,177,49,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
