The basic story -- outcast coach handles a team of outcast kids and turns them from losers into winners -- has been told in a number of films, including Wildcats, The Bad News Bears, Hoosiers, and Youngblood. Here the sport is hockey. Emilio Estevez is Gordon Bombay, a high-powered lawyer haunted by an incident from his past: while playing pee-wee league hockey as a child, young Gordon missed a crucial shot in the state finals game, invoking the wrath of his coach, Mr. Reilly (Lane Smith). When Gordon is arrested for drunk driving, the judge orders him to take a leave of absence and coach a hockey team of misfit kids. At first, Gordon treats the coaching job with contempt. But when his team loses to a team led by his old coach Reilly, the fire under Gordon is lit. Inspired, he leads his team on a mission to succeed. The team begins to win games and soon they are ready to face Reilly\\'s team for the big championship game. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 44 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 720\n\nFrame Height: 304\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55fcb0c22c2aa84f18366eb2bc020795758d0880","amp;dn":"The+Mighty+Ducks%281992%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55fcb0c22c2aa84f18366eb2bc020795758d0880","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,252,176,194,44,42,168,79,24,54,110,178,188,2,7,149,117,141,8,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
