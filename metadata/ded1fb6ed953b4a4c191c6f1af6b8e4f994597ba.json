While the game renders polygons in a typical 3-D fashion, gameplay is 2-D. Players can choose to be either Nikki or Fargus - who have different specialties - with the option to change for each level. During the quest, players can earn extra lives by collecting treasure, which can also active the bonus level &quot;Boarder Run&quot;. Failure in &quot;Boarder Run&quot; does not cost player lives; successfully completing the &quot;Boarder Run&quot; bonus will result in the player earning at least one extra life.\n\nUnique powers collected during gameplay may replace, extend or add to previous powers, depending on which character is in play and which power obtained. The characters handle the unique powers differently. For instance, collecting the &quot;fire power&quot; allows Nikki to shoot destructive fireballs, while it grants Fargus invincibility and a deadly touch, but requires him to constantly move forward. Machines and equipment are also available throughout the game, although they are tied to certain areas.\n\nShould the player collect +80% of treasure in a level, they will have access to the bonus level &quot;Boarder Run&quot;, where they must slide along a course collecting treasure, while simultaneously keeping ahead of a pursuing vortex.\n\nThe player begins with four hit points to represent health. Through bonuses, this can be expanded up to a maximum of 16. To achieve maximum hit points, the player must find one of several &quot;life pieces&quot; in hidden areas of the game. When all points are lost, the character loses a life and returns to the last checkpoint. When all lives are lost, the game is over.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ded1fb6ed953b4a4c191c6f1af6b8e4f994597ba","amp;dn":"Pandemonium+2+%28PC%2FEng%2F1997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ded1fb6ed953b4a4c191c6f1af6b8e4f994597ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,209,251,110,217,83,180,164,193,145,198,241,175,107,142,79,153,69,151,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
