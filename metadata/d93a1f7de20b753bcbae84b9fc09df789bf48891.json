The rest of the album alternates between wistful ballads like &quot;Sonnet&quot; and &quot;Space and Time&quot;, spacey grooves like &quot;Catching the Butterfly&quot; and &quot;The Rolling People&quot;, and all-out rockers like the Led Zeppelin-esque, pounding &quot;Come On&quot;, which closes the album.\n\nThe album received nearly unanimous critical praise upon its release, with Melody Maker naming Urban Hymns as the number-one album of 1997 in its year-end list. In 1998, it won Best British Album at the Brit Awards.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Bitter Sweet Symphony\n[02] Sonnet\n[03] The Rolling People\n[04] The Drugs Don't Work\n[05] Catching The Butterfly\n[06] Neon Wilderness\n[07] Space And Time\n[08] Weeping Willow\n[09] Lucky Man\n[10] One Day\n[11] This Time\n[12] Velvet Morning\n[13] Come On\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:15m:53s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 186mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.1.1.10 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Rock\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nOriginally Released\t- 29 September 1997\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Virgin Records\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.theverve.co.uk \n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  - Too Many Pages To Check * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d93a1f7de20b753bcbae84b9fc09df789bf48891","amp;dn":"%5B1997%5D+Urban+Hymns+-+The+Verve+-+186mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d93a1f7de20b753bcbae84b9fc09df789bf48891","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,58,31,125,226,11,117,59,203,174,132,185,252,9,223,120,155,244,136,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
