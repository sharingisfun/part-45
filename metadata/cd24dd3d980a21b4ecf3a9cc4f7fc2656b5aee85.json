Enduring extremely risky conditions at the edge of the enormous crater, they captured incredible, unparalleled footage of the volcano as it was erupting, spewing fire and ash into the air. Every 10 minutes, the eruption's gigantic sonic boom hit them, rocking them to the core.\n\nThe crew also filmed other dangerous circumstances they faced, including being trapped the road ahead of them disappeared, either due to massive flooding that washed away the blacktop or because seemingly inpenitrable walls of dense ash cloud obscured their way, causing them to lose all sense of direction and making it difficult for them to breathe.\n\nThis timely documentary also presents interviews with eyewitnesses, with geologists who collect samples of lava and ash and analyze them, and with other experts who discuss volcanic activity and its global impact, including the disruption of air travel. Whether you or a loved one were effected directly by the eruption of Eyjafjallajokul, this is a documentary you'll want to see.\n\nRelated: BBC Timewatch Killer cloud &amp; BBC Supervolcanoes.\n\nAirdate: 09/05/2010\nAirtime: 21:00 CET\nChannel: NGC NL\nSize - A/R: 720*400 1:1.78\nAcodec: AC3 192\nVcodec: XviD (2pass mpeg)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd24dd3d980a21b4ecf3a9cc4f7fc2656b5aee85","amp;dn":"NGC+Naked+science+-+Eyjafjallajokull+2010+NLSUB+XviD+AC3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd24dd3d980a21b4ecf3a9cc4f7fc2656b5aee85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,36,221,61,152,10,33,180,236,243,169,204,79,127,194,101,107,90,238,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
