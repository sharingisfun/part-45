He was also a member of the Turkish parliament (the Grand National Assembly of Turkey) between 1942 and 1946.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is one of the most important authors of Turkish literature, successfully combining Eastern and Western cultures within his writings. Yahya Kemal BeyatlÃ„Â± played an important role in his upbringing. In his poetry, he uses Turkish classical music and dreaming as the textile of his works. Both in his poetry and novels psychological analyses, history, the characteristics of his time, the binding between the society and the individual, dreams and the problems of civilization are given a great place. One of his most significant works is The Time Regulation Institute (Saatleri Ayarlama EnstitÃƒÂ¼sÃƒÂ¼). The novel has been widely acclaimed as an ironic criticism of the bureaucratization process with the implication that its title suggests, though that is not what the book is all about. In fact, the book can be read from quite different perspectives, and cannot be exhausted in only one reading. First of all, it is a great psychological analysis of a man who suffers from being unable to adapt himself to his time, in other words to modern times. So the fact of bureaucratization is indeed incorporated into a broader problem: modernization and its impact on the individual. Most of the characters of the novel seem to be struggling in strange ways in order to survive in modern times. In this way, the concept of &quot;time&quot; occupies a central place, giving a deeper sense, even a philosophical taste to the novel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a292cc30fc59e98469bb5c9ea0ee56179c1a12cb","amp;dn":"Ahmet+Hamdi+Tanpinar+-+The+Time+Regulation+Institute","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a292cc30fc59e98469bb5c9ea0ee56179c1a12cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,146,204,48,252,89,233,132,105,187,92,158,160,238,86,23,156,26,18,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
