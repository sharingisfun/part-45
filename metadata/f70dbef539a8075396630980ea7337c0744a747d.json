First he strikes two rascals with his sword, but instead of killing them he turns them into rats. He later visits a blacksmith who reforges his sword.\n\n&quot;Holy Diver&quot; is the first single released by heavy metal band Dio, appearing on their 1983 LP, Holy Diver. Although it only reached #40 on the charts, it is one of Dio's most popular songs.\n\nThe song is prominently featured on the soundtrack to the radio station V-Rock in the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories and is also one of the tracks on the game Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s. It was also played in the South Park episode Hooked on Monkey Phonics, and Philadelphia Phillies slugger Pat Burrell used the song in 2005 and 2006 as his at-bat music. The song was also the lead off song in the Matchstick Films Ski Movie trilogy. - Wikipedia\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRockVOB:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RockVOB/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RockVOB/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDISCLAIMER: Music videos are for promotional use only.
