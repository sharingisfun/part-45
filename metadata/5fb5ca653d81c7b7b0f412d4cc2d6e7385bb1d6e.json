For all that pedigree, though, Moon received little support from their label, Imperial Records, and the group's two albums, 1968's Without Earth and 1969's Moon, went virtually unheard when they were released. Fans of period pop psychedelia found the albums irresistible, however, and the group has enjoyed a kind of low-key cult status ever since, leading to Rev-Ola's reissue of both albums on one CD, along with a handful of bonus tracks that include a couple of mono 45 mixes and three tracks from Moore's pre-Moon band, Matthew Moore Plus 4.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fb5ca653d81c7b7b0f412d4cc2d6e7385bb1d6e","amp;dn":"The+Moon+-+Without+Earth+and+the+Moon+%5B1968%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fb5ca653d81c7b7b0f412d4cc2d6e7385bb1d6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,181,202,101,61,129,199,183,176,244,18,212,204,45,110,115,133,187,29,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
