They have created a unique sound with which to voice their ideas and concerns regarding their endangered traditional way of life. Their last album, Desert Crossroads, was an exploration of the realities of being a nomad in a changing society. This new album reaches a whole new philosophical level, as the band begins to explore their role as human beings, and cultural ambassadors, in a society of continuous global change.\n\nThis album is more than a statement. It is Etran FinatawaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s appeal to a global consciousness and to the decision makers and reactors all over the world. As Alhousseini says in the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ImuzaranÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢:\n\n&quot;Those who are leading the world\npay attention to the tears of the children of this world\nthat you are spending every morning\nand the tears of the women and the men.&quot;\n\nThrough their unique brand of desert blues, Etran Finatawa has enchanted audiences the world over, touring extensively throughout Europe, North America, Africa and the Pacific.\n-- etranfinatawa.com\n\nTracks\n01- Aitimani\n02- Diam Walla\n03- Aitma\n04- Ndiiren\n05- Gourma\n06- DaandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡\n07- Duuniyaaru Dillii\n08- Imuzaran\n09- Ummee Ndaaren\n10- Kalamoujar\n\nAlbum cover, EAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nAudio format: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22ac7ceb6fb5a28c02198b7464c8eef201ad09fd","amp;dn":"Etran+Finatawa+-+Tarkat+Tajje+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22ac7ceb6fb5a28c02198b7464c8eef201ad09fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,172,124,235,111,181,162,140,2,25,139,116,100,200,238,242,1,173,9,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
