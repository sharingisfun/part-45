Jones, Carlos Pacheco and Jesus Merino\nHumanity enslaved! Time shattered and bleeding! Anti-Life triumphant! Can Earth&amp;#039;s demoralized, beaten heroes rally their scattered forces for the ultimate super-battle against the nightmare armies of Apokolips when the forces of good meet the forces of evil on the bridge to BlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼dhaven? As Darkseid&amp;#039;s presence causes reality itself to sicken and the lights to go out across the universe, as even the Guardians fall, the true power of the evil gods finally reveals itself, and a major character returns for a shocking conclusion.\n\nDoes the secret of humankind&amp;#039;s salvation lie in a mysterious cave painting and a bolt of lightning?
