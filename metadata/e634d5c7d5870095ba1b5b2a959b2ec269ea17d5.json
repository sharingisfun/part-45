Rencher, William F. Christensen\n\nISBN: 978-0-470-17896-6\n\nPublisher:Wiley\n\nFormat:pdf\n\nFilled with new and timely content, Methods of Multivariate Analysis, Third Edition provides examples and exercises based on more than sixty real data sets from a wide variety of scientific fields. It takes a &quot;methods&quot; approach to the subject, placing an emphasis on how students and practitioners can employ multivariate analysis in real-life situations.\n\nThis Third Edition continues to explore the key descriptive and inferential procedures that result from multivariate analysis. Following a brief overview of the topic, the book goes on to review the fundamentals of matrix algebra, sampling from multivariate populations, and the extension of common univariate statistical procedures (including t-tests, analysis of variance, and multiple regression) to analogous multivariate techniques that involve several dependent variables. The latter half of the book describes statistical tools that are uniquely multivariate in nature, including procedures for discriminating among groups, characterizing low-dimensional latent structure in high-dimensional data, identifying clusters in data, and graphically illustrating relationships in low-dimensional space. In addition, the authors explore a wealth of newly added topics, including:\n\n    Confirmatory Factor Analysis\n    Classification Trees\n    Dynamic Graphics\n    Transformations to Normality\n    Prediction for Multivariate Multiple Regression\n    Kronecker Products and Vec Notation\n\nNew exercises have been added throughout the book, allowing readers to test their comprehension of the presented material. Detailed appendices provide partial solutions as well as supplemental tables, and an accompanying FTP site features the book's data sets and related SASÃ‚Â® code.\n\nRequiring only a basic background in statistics, Methods of Multivariate Analysis, Third Edition is an excellent book for courses on multivariate analysis and applied statistics at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. The book also serves as a valuable reference for both statisticians and researchers across a wide variety of disciplines.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e634d5c7d5870095ba1b5b2a959b2ec269ea17d5","amp;dn":"Methods+of+Multivariate+Analysis+3rd+Ed.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e634d5c7d5870095ba1b5b2a959b2ec269ea17d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,52,213,199,213,135,0,149,186,27,91,42,149,155,46,194,105,234,23,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
