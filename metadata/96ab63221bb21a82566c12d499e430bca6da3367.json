A song over forty years old leaking in this day and age of the interwebs is almost a farce, given how common it is to witness entire records appearing online in crude mp3 matter months before being released. What is more odd is that someone who calls themselves a Beatles fanatic, such as myself, didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even know this take (it was take 20) existed! IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve known about the infamously mythological Sgt. Pepper-era, LSD-infested unreleased sound collage ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCarnival of LightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the orgasm-inducing approx. seven hour long ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHelter SkelterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ slow-groove jam that Macca wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t release; but IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never heard of this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfull versionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of the White Album classic, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRevolution 1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â³.\n\nAccording to those bickering yet informative sods over at the atease message boards, the extended take leaked as part of a new bootleg, Revolution.. Take Your Knickers Off. Where things start getting interesting is that apparently only two copies of the take in question were ever made at the end of the session: one was taken home by John Lennon and the other by someone whose name isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t noted in EMI documents. Hmmm. Scandalous!\n\nHow does it sound? Well imagine ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRevolution 1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â³, and then imagine ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRevolution 9ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â³. Now, imagine the where the first song normally ends. Then, imagine the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œshooby doo wopÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ back up vocals continuing for a further seven minutes while some of the sound collage noises from number 9 play over the top, eventually arriving to a crescendo before scaring the shit out of us all with a creepy spoken word piece by Yoko. I guess, John decided to chop the song in half, or rather, separate the sanity from insanity.
