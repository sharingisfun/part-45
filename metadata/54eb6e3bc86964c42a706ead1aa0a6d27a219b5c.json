Now, his chilling new novel brings back intrepid heroine Absalom Kearney, a driven police detective with a haunted past, trying to make a difference in a troubled town.\nHangman, Hangman, what do you see? Four little girls, as cute as can be. The eerie schoolyard chant still sends ripples of horror through North Buffalo. Not so long ago, serial killer Marcus Flynn preyed upon the communityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teenaged daughtersÃ¢â‚¬â€until he was cornered and shot in the head. But Flynn lived, carrying to prison the nickname Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hangman,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ along with the secret of his last victimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate. Homicide cop Abbie Kearney wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t around during HangmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reign of terror. She hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yet come home to wear her dadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old badge in the tough Irish American stronghold known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the County.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Abbie had never experienced firsthand the horror of Hangman. Until now.\n \nHangman, Hangman, where do they go? Down on the ground, where the daffodils grow. A corrections officer lies dead, a prison van stands empty . . . and somewhere out there, the monster who condemned innocents to death at the end of a rope watches and waits to strike again. Abbie leads a desperate manhunt through a city driven to its knees by fear, matching wits with a predator as brilliant as he is elusive. But as more victims are claimed, a rising tide of secrecy, paranoia, and politics forces her to realize that stepping beyond the law may be the only way to find justice. Because with each passing hour, the stakes grow higherÃ¢â‚¬â€and HangmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s noose gets tighter.\n\nBlack Irish (Abbie Kearney #1)can be found here:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10376780/Stephan_Talty_-_Black_Irish_(Retail)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10376780/Stephan_Talty_-_Black_Irish_(Retail)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTo leave a Request please visit My Release Thread.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Rose88-My-Book-Uploads&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Rose88-My-Book-Uploads&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThank You.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54eb6e3bc86964c42a706ead1aa0a6d27a219b5c","amp;dn":"Hangman+by+Stephan+Talty+%28Retail%29+%7BRose88%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54eb6e3bc86964c42a706ead1aa0a6d27a219b5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,235,110,59,200,105,100,196,42,112,110,173,26,160,166,210,122,33,155,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
