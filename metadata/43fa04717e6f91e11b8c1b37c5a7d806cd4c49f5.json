The Airbus A330 is the newest addition to the fleet with 8 aircraft planned for operations around the world.\n\n.\nOn this program we ferry the A330 to Chateauroux where the crew does a training flight. From the tower we observe the touch &amp; go and go-around maneuvers before we take the aircraft back to Paris. This is followed by a transatlantic flight to Boston which features a great approach with spectacular views of Boston Logan Airport as well as the city of Boston. Also included a visit in the cabin of this brand new Airbus.\n\n92min\n\nPlease upload more justplanes &amp; airutopia DVDs.
