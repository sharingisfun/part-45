Through a mysterious set of coincidences, he finds himself on an adventure to Peru in search of ancient scrolls, known as the Celestine Prophecy. The prophecy and its nine key insights, predict a new awakening that redefines human life and provides a glimpse into a completely spiritual culture on earth. Resistant at first, skeptical and unsure, John finds that each step he takes, each person he encounters leads him to a new awakening. It is only in this letting go that he finds his destiny and comes to understand the meaning that had escaped him when his adventure began.\n\n\nEnglish subs included in torrent\n\n\nPlease do not hit and run...seed so others may enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:106f5e1e863e979c5d41ab71f7db2af23c3eea5d","amp;dn":"The+Celestine+Prophecy+%282006%29+%5Beng+subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"106f5e1e863e979c5d41ab71f7db2af23c3eea5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,111,94,30,134,62,151,156,93,65,171,113,247,219,42,242,60,62,234,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
