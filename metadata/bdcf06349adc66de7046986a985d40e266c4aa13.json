[Soundcloud], features a bouncy bassline, an R&amp;B backbeat, effective use of a string section and some almost tropical-sounding guitar rearing its head mid-way through the song, which lasts all of six minutes. To top it all off, we have DaviesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s portentous baritone and bleak lyrical outlook (heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just drawing comparisons to Leonard Cohen for his voice, you know), as well as one of the most arresting opening lines weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve heard all year: Ã¢â‚¬ËœThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friends of mine who are trying to get better, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a waste of time in this kind of weatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Things get even gloomier from there, but the contrast between the delivery of the lyrics and the music that surrounds it could not be more marked, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s this contrast, not to mention the melange of styles that Davies throws together, that make Sick Friends one of the most compelling debuts of the year.\n\nLabel: Make Mine\nCopyright: (c) 2012 Make Mine\n\nOfficial Waiting for the Guns video:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdcf06349adc66de7046986a985d40e266c4aa13","amp;dn":"Maigret+Jnr+-+Sick+Friends+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdcf06349adc66de7046986a985d40e266c4aa13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,207,6,52,154,220,102,222,112,70,152,106,152,93,64,226,102,196,170,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
