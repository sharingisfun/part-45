I created these files myself from an original, unscratched game CD.  It's in bin/cue format because I'm not too fond of rips--especially ones that leave out the cheeseball music that makes this game so enchanting.\n\nThis game is a bit old for XP, but will still run.  As linkinpark187 said in the comments:\n\n\n&quot;what you may have to do is:\n\nRight Click Shortcut -&gt; Properties -&gt; Compatibility Tab -&gt; Check Compatibility Mode for -&gt; Windows 98/98SE.&quot;\n\n\nAnd for the record, it works just fine.  I use this myself because CD drives are laggy and noisy, and I had several friends download the torrent for their own use, and none of us ran into any problems.  I wish I could say that I checked the files for copy errors, but I did not.\n\nI recommend using Daemon Tools to mount the .bin file.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3468bb75d5cc58e980b1f25956553c6a10f06f4","amp;dn":"Sonic+R+%28bin%2Fcue%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3468bb75d5cc58e980b1f25956553c6a10f06f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,70,139,183,93,92,197,142,152,11,31,37,149,101,83,198,161,15,6,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
