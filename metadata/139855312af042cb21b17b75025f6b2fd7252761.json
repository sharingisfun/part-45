Over the past half-century, Abel has made a name for himself several times over with stunts that are just ridiculous enough to be believable, especially to a media that feeds on salacious, far-fetched stories. Alan's daughter, Jenny, tells her firsthand account of what it was like growing up with this lovable but slightly demented prankster for a father. Abel Raises Cain takes the audience on a roller coaster ride through the myriad of elaborate hoaxes and schemes that Abel pulled off over the years, all of which were designed to provoke and amuse, while at the same time, make people question everything that they see, hear and read.\n\n \n\nLEARN MORE:\n\nVisit the Abel Raises Cain official site\n\nBuy the DVD\n\nAlanAbel.com\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:139855312af042cb21b17b75025f6b2fd7252761","amp;dn":"Abel+Raises+Cain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"139855312af042cb21b17b75025f6b2fd7252761","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,152,85,49,42,240,66,203,33,177,123,117,2,95,107,47,215,37,39,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
