The environment of Metal Saga seems to be relatively unscathed, with a generally healthy ecosystem and no apparent areas of radioactive contamination. Rather than focusing extensively on mutants and ruffians, many of the enemies encountered are merely machines gone haywire. As a result, scavenging such machines and using scavenged parts to build equipment appear to be common activities.\n\nAdditionally, the game includes a good dose of western and militaristic qualities, with most of the game&amp;#039;s battles being fought from within tanks (or other tank-like armored vehicles).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5468223c459072bd5ed33c89bcb75fd853055af","amp;dn":"Metal+Saga.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5468223c459072bd5ed33c89bcb75fd853055af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,70,130,35,196,89,7,43,213,237,51,200,155,203,117,253,133,48,85,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
