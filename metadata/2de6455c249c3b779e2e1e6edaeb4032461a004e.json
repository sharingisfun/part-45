The line-up was Jalle - vocals / drums, and Emil - guitar / bass. Earcollapse was pure grindcore, influenced by bands such as Sore-Throat, 7 Minutes Of Nausea and early Napalm Death...\n\nIn early 1992, the name was changed to Warcollapse, and songs like &quot;Misery And Despair&quot;, &quot;Bleakness Over Battlefields&quot;, &quot;Massgenocide&quot; and &quot;Warcollapse&quot; were created in the early style of Scandinavian Raw-punk... In May &amp;#039;92, a &quot;test-recording&quot; was done. Warcollapse then went back to that studio to record a demo in June of &amp;#039;92, that became more satisfying. The 1st demo, &quot;Misery And Despair&quot; was spread around, and in the autumn of &amp;#039;92 Kalle joined Warcollapse as drummer. During the winter of &amp;#039;92-&amp;#039;93, Janne joined the band as bassplayer.\n\nIn February &amp;#039;93, the band recorded 4 tracks to appear on 2 releases; a split-EP with Extinction Of Mankind (U.K), that was released by Elderberry Records, and the compilation-CD &quot;War Compilation&quot;, released by Tribal War Asia. Then Warcollapse was offered to be included on the Swedish Compilation-CD &quot;Distortion To Hell&quot;, and the track that was on the &quot;War Compilation&quot;, also winded up on &quot;Distortion To Hell,&quot; together with the left over track from the recording, entitled &quot;Warcollapse&quot;.\n\nOn the 13th of November, Warcollapse played live for the first time. Later that month, Warcollapse recorded the debut-EP &quot;Indoctri-Nation&quot; that was co - released by Japanese label Tribal War Asia and Swedish Elderberry Records, due to the bad pressing on the Japanese version&amp;#039;s b-side. In April &amp;#039;94, Warcollapse toured the U.K, mostly with Substandard, for 8 dates. In June, tracks were recorded for a planned debut-album, but the result wasn&amp;#039;t good enough, so instead the tracks were split up on; a split-EP with Disrupt (U.S.A), released on Crust Records, and a MCD &quot;Crust As Fuck Existence&quot; released by Distortion Records. While the 7&quot; EP&amp;#039;s were in the crusty style, the MCD was more in the vein of Amebix/Axegrinder..slow as fuck crust...\n\n\n\n\nCRUST AS FUCK EXISTENCE\nRecorded June 1994. Distortion Records.\n\nTrack-list:\n1. It&amp;#039;s Time To...\n2. Massgenocide\n3. Crust As Fuck Existence\n4. Bonus-track: Encaged (Death-Dist-mix)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2de6455c249c3b779e2e1e6edaeb4032461a004e","amp;dn":"Warcollapse+-+Crust+as+fuck+existance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2de6455c249c3b779e2e1e6edaeb4032461a004e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,230,69,92,36,156,59,119,158,46,30,110,218,235,64,50,70,26,0,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
