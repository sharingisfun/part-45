At last it's available, and it has been well worth the wait.\n\nYou may be wondering why I consider this to be the best video performance of Meistersinger; after all, there are at least three outstanding productions on DVD.\n\nI'll be honest. One purely personal reason is that it was the first production of Meistersinger I ever saw. They say that the first time for anything is always special....\n\nBut putting that aside, let's consider the production on its merits.\n\nMeistersinger is by far Wagner's most light-hearted, humorous, and above all human operas, but it's also his longest. It puts enormous demands on the performers, since in addition to putting Wagnerian demands on their stamina, it also requires them to show the essential humanity of their characters. Everyone in this opera is a human being, with good and bad points, and, importantly, with a depth of character - they can't be played as caricatures. This doesn't always happen.\nWhat makes this production special is that every performer: the singers, the conductor, the orchestra, the musical and television directors, and every member of the chorus works together to produce a coherent and warmly human performance.\n\nThis is a Bayreuth production, directed by Wolfgang Wagner, with television direction by Brian Large. As one might expect, the quality is excellent.\n\nBernd Weikl is a superb Sachs - one might say the definitive Sachs - thoughtful, melancholy, but with a well-developed sense of fun. The director makes an excellent decision in the prelude to act 3, by showing Sachs peacefully reading his book, instead of the traditional Gables of Olde Nurnberg.
