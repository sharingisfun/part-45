Katherine A. Powers, Boston Globe. Well-written, clear and informed, they have a breezy wit about them....I find them hard to stop reading. Richard Bernstein, New York Times. Witty, illuminating, and blessedly concise. Jim Holt, Wall Street Journal. These brief and enlightening explorations of our greatest thinkers bring their ideas to life in entertaining and accessible fashion. Philosophical thought is deciphered and made comprehensive and interesting to almost everyone. Far from being a novelty, each book is a highly refined appraisal of the philosopher and his work, authoritative and clearly presented","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:292fb3af4c0eb9648642ad3247c63f8fecc351a4","amp;dn":"Sartre+in+90min+-+Paul+Strathern","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"292fb3af4c0eb9648642ad3247c63f8fecc351a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,47,179,175,76,14,185,100,134,66,173,50,71,198,63,143,236,195,81,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
