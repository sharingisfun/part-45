In 1942, the Battle of Los Angeles involved    \n         the US military and Air Defense allegedly fighting a          \n         UFO. WWII Allied Air Force planes were buzzed by balls of     \n         light that some think could have been extraterrestrial. And   \n         the alleged crash of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico   \n         in 1947 propelled the world into the age of UFOs. For         \n         decades, some people have been searching for the sounds       \n         of extraterrestrial intelligence, while others have been      \n         sending messages out into deep space. What would happen if    \n         aliens answered... or came calling? What protocols exist      \n         to determine who would speak on behalf of mankind, and how    \n         might we communicate? What happens if they return? Some       \n          believe they already have.                                    \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                           CTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD                       \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
