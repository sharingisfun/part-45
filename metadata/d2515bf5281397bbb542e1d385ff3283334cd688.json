Having stared death in the face and survived, he was a changed man on record, displaying a new confessional bent and a consistent emotional depth. By and large, this isn't the sort of material that made him a gangsta icon; this is 2Pac the soul-baring artist, the foundation of the immense respect he commanded in the hip-hop community. It's his most thematically consistent, least-self-contradicting work, full of genuine reflection about how he's gotten where he is -- and dread of the consequences. Even the more combative tracks (&quot;Me Against the World,&quot; &quot;Fuck the World&quot;) acknowledge the high-risk life he's living, and pause to wonder how things ever went this far. He battles occasional self-loathing, is haunted by the friends he's already lost to violence, and can't escape the desperate paranoia that his own death isn't far in the future. These tracks -- most notably &quot;So Many Tears,&quot; &quot;Lord Knows,&quot; and &quot;Death Around the Corner&quot; -- are all the more powerful in hindsight with the chilling knowledge that he was right. Even romance takes on a new meaning as an escape from the hellish pressure of everyday life (&quot;Temptations,&quot; &quot;Can U Get Away&quot;), and when that's not available, getting high or drunk is almost a necessity. He longs for the innocence of childhood (&quot;Young Niggaz,&quot; &quot;Old School&quot;), and remembers how quickly it disappeared, yet he still pays loving, clear-eyed tribute to his drug-addicted mother on the touching &quot;Dear Mama.&quot; Overall, Me Against the World paints a bleak, nihilistic picture, but there's such an honest, self-revealing quality to it that it can't help conveying a certain hope simply through its humanity. It's the best place to go to understand why 2Pac is so revered; it may not be his definitive album, but it just might be his best. -- Steve Huey \n \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Intro [01:40] \n 02.If I die 2nite [04:02] \n 03.Me against the world ft.
