Having a single comprehensive reference for the compact models of most commonly used semiconductor devices (both active and passive) represents a significant advantage for the reader. Indeed, several kinds of semiconductor devices are routinely encountered in a single IC design or in a single modeling support group.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0422c383f570f993fcc6ae0686f3c1c2ed670f87","amp;dn":"Compact+Modeling%3A+Principles%2C+Techniques+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0422c383f570f993fcc6ae0686f3c1c2ed670f87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,34,195,131,245,112,249,147,252,198,174,6,134,243,193,194,237,103,15,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
