This book examines the uniforms, equipment, history and organisation of the Gurkha rifles. It traces the 19th Century origins of the now famous Gurkha regiments and also covers their service history during the Great Mutiny of 1857 and the 3rd Afghan War (1919). During the two World Wars the Gurhah rifles performed countless tours of duty and their regimental battle honours listed in the book bear testimony to their extensive service.
