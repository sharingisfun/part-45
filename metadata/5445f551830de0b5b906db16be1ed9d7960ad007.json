First, he steps lightly as he follows one of the state' leading herpetologist as he tracks and collects some of the most venomous snakes in the world. He then brings them in to a place called the Serpentairum where he helps milk the poisonous venom so it can be used for future cures. Larry then takes a break a nearby corn maze to celebrate America's leading cash crop and try to write his own message in the corn. Finally, Larry joins a merry band of trappers to learn the art of armadillo huntingÃ¢â‚¬â€œand armadillo eating.
