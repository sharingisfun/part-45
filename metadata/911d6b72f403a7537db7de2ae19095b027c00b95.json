I went to try and find a version to download quick and I couldn't find anything but shit. Either it was loaded with spyware or the shitty keygens it was packaged with didn't actually work. I came to realize there was a serious issue with trying to find alcohol 120% anywhere. So here is my clean 100% guaranteed to work version that I've been using for a long time. It's not the absolute latest but it has almost everything save blue-ray support/format. Works great for making images of CDs, burning images of several different formats (.iso, .mds, .bwt, .b5t, .b6t, .ccd, .cue, .bin, etc...), and use virtual drives to emulate disks.\n\n\nOperating systems: MS Windows 2000/XP/Vista 32bit/64bit\nNote: doesn't work on windows 7 build 6933\nHomepage: http://www.alcohol-software.com\n\n\nThe installer is really nice and pretty straight forward. It was a program written by a third party that has the serial and installer in one.\n\nIf you have any issues please leave a comment.\n\n\n\n-Biggy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:911d6b72f403a7537db7de2ae19095b027c00b95","amp;dn":"Alcohol+120%25+-++tried+and+true%2C+no+viruses%2C+no+bullshit+-+Biggy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"911d6b72f403a7537db7de2ae19095b027c00b95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,29,107,114,244,3,167,83,125,183,222,42,225,144,149,176,39,192,11,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
