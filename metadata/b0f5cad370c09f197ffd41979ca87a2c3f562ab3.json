In the second half of the show, Max talks to analyst and newslettter writer, Rob Kirby of Kirby Analytics, about the derivatives complex as a price control grid and about the fact that every time the JP Morgan monster needs a feeding, something must die. \n\n\n\nThe .mp3 in the torrent is audio extracted from the Russia Today video.
