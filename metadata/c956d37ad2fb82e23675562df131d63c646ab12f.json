From this child is descended the holy lineage of The Magdalena, a royal bloodline that passes great power and great honor from mother to daughter. The Magdalena serves as the warrior and protector of the Catholic Church.[1]\n\nThe Magdalena has the inherent ability to see into the human heart, to show people the error of their ways and give them the choice to redeem their sins. There is only one in a generation, and she alone stands and takes arms against the evils of the world. Apart from the powers she is born with, The Magdalena wields the Spear of Destiny, the spear that pierced the side of Christ, as a holy and formidable weapon against the twisted and the evil.\n\nSince the Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church has been the Magdalena's employer. They raise her from childhood and train her until she is ready to take hold of her destiny. It is the Inquisition, a secretive and mystical but powerful council of cardinals, that oversees the Magdalena's activities and chooses her missions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c956d37ad2fb82e23675562df131d63c646ab12f","amp;dn":"Magdalena+v3+%281-7%29-+Up+to+date","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c956d37ad2fb82e23675562df131d63c646ab12f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,86,211,122,210,251,130,226,54,117,86,45,241,49,214,60,100,106,177,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
