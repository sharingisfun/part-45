McCarthy accused the Army of holding Schine hostage to keep him from searching for Communists in the Army. These hearings resulted in McCarthy's eventual censure for conduct unbecoming a senator. &quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab3341e9e9300c91f78083778b854e8ac04943d7","amp;dn":"Point+of+Order+%281964%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab3341e9e9300c91f78083778b854e8ac04943d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,51,65,233,233,48,12,145,247,128,131,119,139,133,78,138,192,73,67,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
