Their music has been categorized as space rock, and lyrics are dominated by science fiction themes. In November 2011, Cameron Hawkins has been quoted by the OhioProg 2012 organizers as having reformed the band with two new players. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTonight 1987\n\n\nTonight is the sixth album by FM, a progressive rock group from Toronto, Canada, released on Duke Street Records in 1987. It was their last studio album, but further albums of live and demo material were issued later.\n\nTwo members of this version of the group did not appear on any other FM albums: Simon Brierley (ex Lee Aaron's band and Strange Advance) on guitars, and Greg Critchley (ex Portland Bros. and The Spoons) on drums, the latter replacing Martin Deller. Other lineups of FM were notable for not using electric guitars, therefore this change made a significant alteration to their sound.\n\nThe album was first issued on green vinyl as a limited edition, followed by a black vinyl edition. A CD edition was also released. The CD is augmented by five tracks from FM's previous album, Con-Test.[1] The acquisition of release rights for those tracks from MCA Records (who had reissued Con-Test in 1986, the original edition being on Quality Records in 1985) led to Duke Street reissuing the full album as a CD. Duke Street did not reissue another vinyl edition of that album.\n\nTonight includes a cover version of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; by The Beach Boys. Five other songs from the album also appeared in the horror film Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988): tracks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9.[2][3]\n\nThe green vinyl edition came with a 6-inch by 4-inch sticker, and an order form for band paraphernalia (shirts, buttons, etc.) including fan club membership application. According to the form, members would receive a copy of a &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; single with a non-album instrumental version of the song on the B-side, not available elsewhere, as well as a poster and a quarterly newsletter subscription.\n\nThe cover art was a detail of a painting called &quot;The Dreamer&quot; by Robert Vanderhorst.\n\nIn 1986, prior to the album's release, &quot;She Does What She Wants&quot; was issued as a single on MCA, their previous label,[2] which suggests Tonight was intended as an MCA release initially. &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; was issued privately as a single to members of the group's fan club. Other singles (on Duke Street) include &quot;Dream Girl&quot; backed with &quot;The Real Thing&quot; (1987), &quot;Magic (In Your Eyes)&quot; backed with &quot;I'm Not Mad (Ready for the World)&quot; (1988), and another release of &quot;She Does What She Wants&quot; backed with &quot;She Does What She Wants (Front and Main Mix, Acapella Version)&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Magic (In Your Eyes)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:12\n2.\t&quot;Dream Girl&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n3.\t&quot;She Does What She Wants&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n4.\t&quot;I'm Not Mad (Ready for the World)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n5.\t&quot;Alone Together&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:55\n6.\t&quot;Take the Time to Dream&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n7.\t&quot;Lost in Thought (When I Get Caught)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n8.\t&quot;Good Vibrations&quot; (Brian Wilson, Mike Love) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n9.\t&quot;The Real Thing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n10.\t&quot;(On the) Night Flight&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus tracks from CD Edition \n\nThese tracks originally appeared on FM's previous album, Con-Test.\n\n1.\t&quot;Just Like You&quot; (Hawkins, Martin Deller, Slash, Waite) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n2.\t&quot;We Hold On&quot; (Hawkins, Deller, Slash) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n3.\t&quot;All of the Dreams&quot; (Hawkins, Deller, Slash) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n4.\t&quot;Until the Night is Over&quot; (Hawkins, Deller, Slash) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n5.\t&quot;Why Don't You Take It&quot; (Hawkins, Deller, Slash) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39343ddc14efbb82322c9ec1a7267d03269ea5d5","amp;dn":"FM+-+Tonight+1987+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39343ddc14efbb82322c9ec1a7267d03269ea5d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,52,61,220,20,239,187,130,50,44,158,193,167,38,125,3,38,158,165,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
