The first reported case of the virus was found in 6 year old twin sisters Tiffany &amp; Theresa Morrisey. Tiffany never survived the infection but Theresa made a full recovery and is now believed to be the key to finding a cure. In the chaos of a city-wide evacuation, Theresa goes missing. You must travel back to the abandoned city of Oxford to find her before the virus spreads globally. Be wary however ... you're not the only one back in town.\n\nMain Game Features\n220+ Scenes to navigate\nHD Widescreen mode: see more action!\nCustomizable difficulty: set challenges how you like them\nCollector's Edition includes a behind the scenes making-of video\nUNRAR &amp; ENJOY!\n\nTHANKS TO VELOCITY\n\nextract and play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20765fb2c701fbfbe0ce7aa89adb4a797b66e716","amp;dn":"Infected+The+Twin+Vaccine+CE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20765fb2c701fbfbe0ce7aa89adb4a797b66e716","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,118,95,178,199,1,251,251,224,206,122,168,154,219,74,121,123,102,231,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
