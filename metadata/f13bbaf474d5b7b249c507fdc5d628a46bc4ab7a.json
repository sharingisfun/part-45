Its grand concept alone raised a few eyebrows as soon as the title was announced Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a time travel story seeking to bring the original first class of X-Men face-to-face with their modern day counterparts (a living, breathing, pre-Phoenix Jean Grey included). Then, as time wore on, it became clear that CyclopsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ role in proceedings would be far removed from the heroic leader and moral compass that fans and fellow X-Men alike had rallied around for decades.\n\nAnd then there was Bendis. While IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m mindful not to try and speak for a whole cross-section of fandom, the feeling I got was that though the divisive writer hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really set foot in this corner of the Marvel universe before, the X-community were quite happy for things to stay that way. I guess I can see why. Yes, All New X-Men features far more talking than punching, and yes, a major characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death is teased from pretty much the opening page; these and other Bendis trademarks are in full effect. But on the other hand I think Bendis is at his best when, as with Ultimate Spider-Man and sometimes The Avengers, a book presents him with a strong family dynamic with which he can craft powerful hooks to pull at your heart-strings; and family dynamics donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come much stronger than those within the X-Men.
