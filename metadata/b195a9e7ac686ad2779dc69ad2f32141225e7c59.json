On their first official release, &quot;Collapsing Stars&quot;, this ambitious quartet reveals a wide range of diversity as evidenced by dreamy/poppy songs like &quot;Tides&quot; and the happy-go-lucky &quot;Little Moments&quot;. Emotions shift on darker songs like the eerie &quot;Gossamer&quot;, the spacey &quot;Graviton&quot; and the uptempo blistering title track &quot;Collapsing Stars&quot;. This EP is an collection of rock songs each with their own character that has a little bit of something for everyone. Star Lake wants to welcome you, the listener, to their universe. We hope you enjoy the stay.\n\nMEMBERS:\nMIKE - VOCALS/GUITAR\nANTHONY - GUITAR\nJOSH - DRUMS\nJORGE - BASS\n\nTrack List:\n1.Collapsing Stars\n2.Graviton\n3.Tides\n4.Little Moments\n5.Gossamer\n\n\nBitrate: 320kbps CBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b195a9e7ac686ad2779dc69ad2f32141225e7c59","amp;dn":"Star+Lake+-+Collapsing+Stars+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b195a9e7ac686ad2779dc69ad2f32141225e7c59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,149,169,231,172,104,106,210,119,157,198,154,210,243,33,65,34,94,124,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
