Their new Labrador EP is exemplary of their genre-fusing music and is the result of many months of basement sessions. Slaves to their passion they play as though every song were their last - the kind of drive born from one too many nine to fives. Make sure you pick this up.\n\n*NOTE* This is an official band-sponsored torrent and is 100% legal to download and share. Get the word out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7fe3581b2b01c4e58811650ce6d1020d60d1991","amp;dn":"Loyal+Divide+-+Labrador+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7fe3581b2b01c4e58811650ce6d1020d60d1991","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,254,53,129,178,176,28,78,88,129,22,80,206,109,16,32,214,13,25,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
