His last two books, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Ghost Wars and New York Times bestseller The Bin Ladens, have been praised for their creative insight and complex yet compelling narratives-and have put him on par with journalists such as the legendary Bob Woodward. Now, for the first time ever, the paperback edition of On the Grand Trunk Road is finally available, revised and updated with new material. Focusing on Coll's journeys in conflict-ridden India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Afghanistan as a bureau chief for The Washington Post, On the Grand Trunk Road reveals a little-seen area of the world where violence, corruption, and greed have had devastating effects on South Asians from all walks of life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f86ecdc17ffb0a72eed79aa1325c53299ce6b74","amp;dn":"On+the+Grand+Trunk+Road+A+Journey+into+South+Asia+by+Steve+Coll","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f86ecdc17ffb0a72eed79aa1325c53299ce6b74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,134,236,220,23,255,176,167,46,237,121,170,19,37,197,50,153,206,107,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
