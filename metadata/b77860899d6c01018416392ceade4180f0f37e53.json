I noticed they are kind of hard to find also, so if you are a Steve Miller / Steve Miller Band fan and want to listen to him live this is for you, if you didn't know it existed you should download it, it's great.\n\nTracks 1-9 Live at Ultrasonic Studios, New York - 27 March 1973\nTracks 10-13 Live in Amsterdam - 18 February 1972\n\n1.My Dark Hour\t\n2.Jackson-Kent Blues\n3.Welcome\n4.Blues With A Feeling\n5.Shu Ba Du Ma Ma Ma Ma\t\n6.Crossroads\n7.Gangster Of Love\n8.Space Cowboy\n9.Living In The U.S.A\n10.The Gangster Is Back\n11.Blues Without A Name\n12.Going To The Country\t\n13.Brand New Day\n\nTo repeat this again: THIS IS A LIVE COMPILITION. It is not an album, earliest known compilation I can find is  DaveSwift on bootlegzone, so if you would like to thank someone for finding the tracks thank him, I just made a torrent because I noticed no one really had.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b77860899d6c01018416392ceade4180f0f37e53","amp;dn":"The+Gangster+is+Back","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b77860899d6c01018416392ceade4180f0f37e53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,120,96,137,157,108,1,1,132,22,57,44,234,222,65,128,240,243,126,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
