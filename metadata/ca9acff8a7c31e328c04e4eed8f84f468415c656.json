It includes such sumptuous ballads as \\&quot;What Love Has Joined Together\\&quot; and \\&quot;Gonna Keep On Trying Till I Win Your Love,\\&quot; plus uptempo wailers and an occasional dud (\\&quot;Stop The War Now\\&quot;). The early tracks show the group evolving from its doo-wop roots into soul\\&amp;#039;s premier group. While the cuts on this disc aren\\&amp;#039;t the ones that made The Temptations popular music institutions, they\\&amp;#039;re still a vital part of their legacy.\n\n\n01.
