(CRC, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4822-5232-3\r\n\r\nAn ever-increasing dependence on green energy has brought on a renewed interest in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis as a viable solution for hydrogen production. While alkaline water electrolyzers have been used in the production of hydrogen for many years, there are certain advantages associated with PEM electrolysis and its relevance to renewable energy sources. PEM Electrolysis for Hydrogen Production: Principles and Applications discusses the advantages of PEM electrolyzers over alkaline electrolyzers, presents the recent advances of hydrogen PEM fuel cells accelerating the large-scale commercialization of PEM electrolysis, and considers the challenges that must be addressed before PEM electrolysis can become a commercially feasible option.\r\n\r\nWritten by international scientists in PEM electrolysis and fuel cell research areas, this book addresses the demand for energy storage technologies that store intermittent renewable energy and offers the most complete and up-to-date information on PEM electrolysis technology and research.\r\n\r\nThe authors:\r\n\r\nCover the fundamental applications of PEM electrolysis\r\nReview the state-of-the-art technologies and challenges related to each of the components of the PEM electrolysis\r\nAddress failure analysis and review available failure diagnostic tools\r\nProvide future direction for researchers and technology developers\r\n\r\nPEM Electrolysis for Hydrogen Production: Principles and Applications provides a fundamental understanding of the requirements and functionalities of certain components and attributes of the PEM electrolysis technology that are common for both PEM fuel cellsâ€™ and electrolyzersâ€™ hydrogen applications for energy storage. Beneficial to students and professionals, the text serves as a handbook for identifying PEM electrolysis failure modes and diagnosing electrolyzer performance to improve efficiency and durability","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfc0761a073b407c3fd4d75235e9bd4ebc78c4f7","amp;dn":"PEM+Electrolysis+for+Hydrogen+Production","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfc0761a073b407c3fd4d75235e9bd4ebc78c4f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,192,118,26,7,59,64,124,63,212,215,82,53,233,189,78,188,120,196,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
