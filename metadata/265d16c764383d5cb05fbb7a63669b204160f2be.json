But since there seems to be a lot &quot;similarly&quot; &lt;cough&gt; named rips now I guess I should explain.\n\n I try to present the &quot;ultimate mastering&quot; of a particular LP, the &quot;mastering&quot; is not my equipment or process but the source material, it has always been about finding the best source. Now my opinion of the best source is subject to change as I experience more variations. Whether or not folks think my rip is &quot;definitive&quot; is irrelevant to me, I just try to find the best pressing and don't mind doing the extra clean up that comes with not just ripping new reissues or japanese issues. I understand the appeal of these pressings but I don't subscribe to the notion that they represent the best source 95% of the time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:265d16c764383d5cb05fbb7a63669b204160f2be","amp;dn":"%5B24%2F96%5D+Emerson%2C+Lake+and+Palmer+-+1970%2C+Vinyl+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"265d16c764383d5cb05fbb7a63669b204160f2be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,93,22,199,100,56,61,92,176,95,187,122,99,102,155,32,65,96,242,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
