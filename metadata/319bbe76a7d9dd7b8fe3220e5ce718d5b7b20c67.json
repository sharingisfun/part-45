G. Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom on October 15, 1971 by Barrie &amp; Jenkins, London and in the United States on October 15, 1971 by Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., New York under the name Jeeves and the Tie that Binds (with, interestingly, a slightly different ending which omits the final disclosure by Jeeves about the eighteen pages from the Junior Ganymede club book).\n\nWritten only a few years before his death, Much Obliged, Jeeves is the second-to-last appearance of Wodehouse&amp;#039;s much-loved characters, Jeeves and Bertie Wooster (the last being Aunts Aren&amp;#039;t Gentlemen (1974)). It forms the fourth and final installment of the Totleigh Towers saga, though it actually takes place at Brinkley Court, the seat of Bertie&amp;#039;s Aunt Dahlia, near the town of Market Snodsbury","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:319bbe76a7d9dd7b8fe3220e5ce718d5b7b20c67","amp;dn":"P.G.+Wodehouse+-+Much+Obliged%2C+Jeeves","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"319bbe76a7d9dd7b8fe3220e5ce718d5b7b20c67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,155,190,118,167,217,221,123,143,227,34,14,92,231,24,213,183,178,12,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
