Richie, (David Hunter), has a friend on the island, Hene (Eric Edwards), who is gregarious and mischievous. Like the more sensitive Richie, he too was 19. During that summer of awakening he loses his youthful desires and develops his manhood. On the way to the movies, Richie literally bumps into Laura, (introducing Marcia Moon,) an older woman who lives nearby. She asks him if he'll help her with some chores the following day. He is totally flustered, but agrees. Richie goes to her house and after knocking on the door, and getting no response, enters. On the floor he finds a crumpled telegram which reads, 'Your husband, Bob Hayes, has been killed in action.' Laura appears, lonely and vulnerable. She moves toward him in a gesture of human contact. They slowly begin to dance. 'That summer we lost 5 frisbees, saved a girl from a silly snake, saw our first skin flck, and I lost my Laura.' The sea rises and the past is over. .&quot;\n\nStudio:VCX, Stars: Kim Pope, Helen Madigan, David Hunter, Marsha Moon\nSize:685Mb, Type:AVI, Duration:01:13:04, Video: DivX 5 640x464 29.97fps 1172Kbps, Audio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 128Kbps \n\n\nScreens &amp; Covers:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://porn9.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://porn9.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-6.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e201d861cdb971a7f8b4ad8bf6617bc8cf1b9f0","amp;dn":"Summer+of+Laura+-+Kim+Pope+and+Helen+Madigan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e201d861cdb971a7f8b4ad8bf6617bc8cf1b9f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,32,29,134,28,219,151,26,127,139,74,216,191,102,23,188,140,241,185,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
