This 1991 CD puts the focus on the talented and fairly original organist, whose style falls between Jimmy Smith and Wild Bill Davis. Joined by guitarist Rene Thomas and drummer Kenny Clarke for a studio set (the only one by this particular trio), Louiss performs two basic originals (including Clarke's &quot;Don't Want Nothin',&quot; awhich uses the &quot;Ja Da&quot; chord changes), Miles Davis' &quot;Nardis,&quot; a heated version of &quot;Hot House,&quot; Horace Silver's catchy &quot;No Smoking&quot; and &quot;You've Changed.&quot; An excellent all-around showcase that serves as a fine introduction to the very viable organist. ~ Scott Yanow Recorded at Studios Davout, Paris, France. Includes liner notes by Alain Gerber. Eddy Louiss Trio: Eddy Louiss (organ); Rene Thomas (bass); Kenny Clarke (drums). Down Beat (3/98, p.64) - 4 stars (out of 5) - &quot;...Louiss is a remarkable bop-rooted artist....he plays lines rich with ideas, and swings hard....the musicians exhibit the kind of relaxed concentration that comes from playing together regularly...&quot; (cduniverse)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Nardis\n02 - Blue Tempo\n03 - Hot House\n04 - No Smoking\n05 - You've Changed\n06 - Don't Want Nothin'\n\nEnjoy and share!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e796cf9baf40652dee3b327fafc76266f814cef6","amp;dn":"Eddy+Louiss+-+1999+-+Eddy+Louiss+Trio+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e796cf9baf40652dee3b327fafc76266f814cef6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,150,207,155,175,64,101,45,238,59,50,127,175,199,98,102,248,20,206,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
