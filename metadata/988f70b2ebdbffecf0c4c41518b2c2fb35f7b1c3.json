Thompson's then manager Gary Stamler negotiated a deal with Capitol Records and Thompson cut his first album for his new label in 1988.\n\nThis was a good time for Thompson to be at Capitol. The label was managed by Hale Milgrim at the time and Milgrim was a fan of Thompson and his work. Thus Capitol invested more money and effort into promoting Thompson than had been the case in the past and with other labels.\n\nMitchell Froom was retained as producer, and the album was again recorded in Los Angeles with American session musicians providing most of the backing. Thompson still used British players to lend specifically British touches to some songs. In particular long-time collaborators John Kirkpatrick, Aly Bain and Philip Pickett are used, and members of the Fairey Engineering Band provide a brass backing to I Still Dream that owes more to the Salvation Army than it does to Memphis or any other American centre of music.\n\nThe album was (as usual) well received by the music press, and sales, whilst not stellar, were boosted by Capitol's commitment to promoting artist and album.\n[edit]\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Richard Thompson\n&quot;Turning Of The Tide&quot;\n&quot;Gypsy Love Songs&quot;\n&quot;Reckless Kind&quot;\n&quot;Jerusalem On The Jukebox&quot;\n&quot;I Still Dream&quot;\n&quot;Don't Tempt Me&quot;\n&quot;Yankee, Go Home&quot;\n&quot;Can't Win&quot;\n&quot;Waltzing's For Dreamers&quot;\n&quot;Pharaoh&quot;\n\nReleased\tOctober 1988\nRecorded\t1988 at Sunset Sound, Los Angeles and Konk Studios, London\nGenre\tRock\nLength\t43:39\nLabel\tCapitol\n\nProducer\tMitchell Froom\n\nPersonnel\nRichard Thompson - guitar, vocals, mandolin, hammer dulcimer\nMitchell Froom - portative organ, regal, Chamberlin, stereophonic Optigan, electric harp, organ, producer\nJerry Scheff - bass guitar on 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, &amp; 10\nTony Levin - bass guitar, stick on 3, 6, &amp; 8\nMickey Curry - drums on 2, 3, 6, 7, 8\nJim Keltner - drums on 1, 4, 5, 10\nAlex AcuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±a - percussion\nChristine Collister - backing vocals\nClive Gregson - backing vocals\nJohn Kirkpatrick - accordion, anglo-concertina, bass vocals\nPhilip Pickett - shawm, recorder, curtal, peking that, bass racket\nAly Bain - fiddle\nBrian Taylor - cornet\nTony Goddard - cornet\nDavid Horn - tenor horn\nIan Peters - euphonium\nFred Tackett - guitar\nFrances Kelly - baroque harp\nDanny Thompson - double bass\nAlistair Anderson - northumbrian pipes\nTchad Blake ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ recordist\nMike Kloster ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2nd engineer\nTed Patterson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2nd engineer\nBob Ludwig ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ mastering\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:988f70b2ebdbffecf0c4c41518b2c2fb35f7b1c3","amp;dn":"Richard+Thompson...Amnesia%281988%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"988f70b2ebdbffecf0c4c41518b2c2fb35f7b1c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,143,112,178,235,219,255,236,240,196,196,21,24,178,194,251,53,247,177,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
