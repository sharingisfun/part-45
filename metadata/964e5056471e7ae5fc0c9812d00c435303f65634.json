Time is Short Friends.\n\nDescription:\nA Question of Origins (with Dutch subtitles):\nDuring the last century, many globally accepted evolution as fact. However, recent discoveries in almost every area of ??science speak of these molecules-to-man theory against. Search for the origin of life takes you on an inspiring journey through science and Scripture in the search for the beginning of humanity. The theory of evolution has been applied to most areas of science, and this DVD examines the latest discoveries in the field of cosmology, chemistry and biology. Confirms the observable evidence evolution? Or does the evolutionary bias many blinded to the overwhelming data that point to an awesome Creator? Understanding the true origin of man is essential in determining one's destination. This visually rich production shows were convincing evidence that the universe and all life created. Moreover reveals scientific knowledge, which is only found in the Bible, the God of the Bible is the Creator. Seeing Quest for the origin of life is essential when someone questions or doubts concerning the scientific accuracy of the Word of God. Is our solar system created by the Big Bang? Can chemical compounds spontaneously evolve into life? Evolution explains the variety of life on earth?\n\nGedurende de laatste eeuw hebben velen wereldwijd de evolutietheorie als een feit geaccepteerd. Echter, recente ontdekkingen op bijna elk gebied van de wetenschap spreken deze van-moleculen-tot-mens theorie tegen. Zoektocht naar de oorsprong van het leven neemt u mee op een inspirerende reis door wetenschap en de Schrift in de speurtocht naar het begin van het mensdom. De evolutietheorie is toegepast op de meeste gebieden van de wetenschap, en deze DVD onderzoekt de laatste ontdekkingen op het gebied van kosmologie, chemie en biologie. Bevestigt het waarneembare bewijs de evolutie? Of heeft het evolutionaire vooroordeel velen verblind voor de overweldigende gegevens welke wijzen naar een ontzagwekkende Schepper? Het begrijpen van de echte oorsprong van de mens is essentieel in het bepalen van iemands bestemming. Deze visueel rijke productie toont overtuigend bewijs dat het universum en al het leven geschapen werden. Bovendien openbaart wetenschappelijke voorkennis, die alleen in de Bijbel gevonden wordt, dat de God van de Bijbel de Schepper is. Het zien van Zoektocht naar de oorsprong van het leven is essentieel wanneer iemand vragen of twijfels heeft aangaande de wetenschappelijke juistheid van het Woord van God. Is ons zonnestelsel door de oerknal ontstaan? Kunnen chemische samenstellingen zich spontaan tot leven ontwikkelen? Verklaart evolutie de grote variÃƒÂ«teit van leven op aarde?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnceient Chinese Writing Tells The Biblical Story - The Flood, The plan of Salvation all in Ancient Chinese Language:\nThis is a must see presentation! The first video I have personally seen to discuss this topic in depth and non-believers will also be amazed. Was the flood just a fable? What was the original Chinese religion?  We should be mindful that the oldest known Religion is not a religion at all. It is the Word of God that existed long before man and will continue to exist long after we are gone. Religion is a man-made concept of divinity and worship that has perverted God's Holy Word which has given rise to many false doctrines. But conforming to that description, Judeo Christianity is the oldest form which happens to begin from the time of Adam &amp; Eve but the Jews were not the first to document God and His relationship with mankind.\n\n\n\nIn 221 BC, Qin Shi Huang united China and built the Great Wall of China. There were many past Emperors who were believers in God as the knowledge was passed down over generations. Although Qin Shi Huang may not have been a believer, he knew God's word. So he changed the characture for Sin to better reflect the 4 Sins or contradictions in Genesis 3: 1-2, 4-5; the devil's manipulation of Eve to eat the fruit of the forbidden tree!  \n\n\nPyramids, Planets and the Bible - Chuck Missler:\nTying the planet Mars, the moon, and the Egyptian Great Pyramid into scripture, Chuck shows why he is the master of Biblical intrigue. He also talks about the Ark of the Covenant..

Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series at http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41 ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
