The fiercely independent Canadian singer/songwriter's 16th album listens like a stagecoach trip down Route 66, taking its own sweet time in order to sniff out every corner like an Old West Canterbury Tales. The Springsteen-esque opener, &quot;18 Wheels,&quot; follows the plight of a lovelorn truckdriver trying to fight the urge to plead his way back into the arms of his estranged lover. It's a fitting start for Milly's Cafe, a sparse and determined collection of stories that refuses to ever break into a gallop -- even the rolling title cut, a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-inspired tale of guns and redemption, barely achieves midtempo. Still, it's an affecting album that uses the space allotted to it as a strength. The languid &quot;Summer Is Over&quot; is all Ferris wheels and small-town lemonade, while the heartbreaking &quot;Rocky,&quot; which follows the correspondence between two weathered and ailing cowboys withering away in separate retirement homes, keeps reality clearly in check. It's a road-trip record in the classic sense, and one that's got a confection for whatever mood you may find yourself in.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69c33e53bc994f11d293f9931a4b939d75b865de","amp;dn":"Fred+Eaglesmith+-+Milly%27s+Cafe+%5B2006%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69c33e53bc994f11d293f9931a4b939d75b865de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,195,62,83,188,153,79,17,210,147,249,147,26,75,147,157,117,184,101,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
