If not her strongest work ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a number of songs sound okay without being particularly stellar, especially given Bush's past heights ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Red Shoes is still an enjoyable listen with a number of diversions. The guest performer list is worthy of note alone, ranging from Procol Harum keyboardist Gary Brooker and Eric Clapton to Prince, but this is very much a Kate Bush album straight up as opposed to a collaborative work like, say, Santana's Supernatural. Opening song &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot; is actually one of her strongest singles in years, a big and punchy song served well with a horn section, though slightly let down by the stiff percussion. &quot;Eat the Music,&quot; another smart choice for a single, mixes calypso and other Caribbean musical touches with a great, classically Bush lyric mixing up sexuality, romance, and various earthy food-based metaphors. Another highlight of Bush's frank embrace of the lustier side of life is &quot;The Song of Solomon,&quot; a celebratory piece about the Bible's openly erotic piece. Those who prefer her predominantly piano and vocal pieces will enjoy &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot; with a strong string arrangement courtesy of Michael Kamen. Other standouts include &quot;Why Should I Love You?&quot; with Prince creating a very Prince-like arrangement and backing chorus for Bush (and doing quite well at that) and the concluding &quot;You're the One,&quot; with Brooker laying down some of his trademark Hammond organ sound for the slow piece.&quot;\n\nRolling Stone review:\n&quot;On her first album since The Sensual World, in 1989, Kate Bush continues in the manner of that album's verbal directness while displaying a melodic sense that's in peak form ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ there are more hooks on The Red Shoes, both subtle and obvious, than on any of her releases since The Dreaming, in 1982. Bush seems content now to dress her songs in simpler ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ though still occasionally antic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ colors. The result is offbeat pop that refines but doesn't sacrifice her signal eccentricity. While the music has settled down somewhat, Bush herself remains rambunctious, and it's a saving grace. A sighing remembrance like &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot; or the purple pleas of &quot;Big Stripey Lie&quot; could have the cloying aura of pressed flowers if they weren't put across with conviction and a tendency to really belt. &quot;And So Is Love&quot; is typical of Bush's aggressively sad torch songs, built of simple phrases theatrically enunciated and enhanced by dramatic support from guest Eric Clapton. It's not all fainting hearts on Shoes, though. The mood ranges from the pure pop of &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot; to the exuberant reel of the title cut (an homage to the classic film), from the wistful verse and funky chorus of the Prince collaboration &quot;Why Should I Love You?&quot; to the West Indies-flavored &quot;Eat the Music.&quot; The Red Shoes is a solid collection of well-crafted and seductively melodic showcases for Bush's hypercabaret style.&quot; \n\nTRACKS:\n01.
