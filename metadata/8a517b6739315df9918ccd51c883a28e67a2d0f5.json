The text has been developed from a graduate course taught by the author for several years, and by presenting a mix of basic theory and real-life examples, he closes the gap between theory and experiment. \nThe first part, on basic biophysical chemistry, surveys fundamental spectroscopic techniques and properties that are the prerequisite for the more sophisticated technologies discussed later in the book. The second part covers the latest bioanalytical techniques based on physical methods, such as confocal fluorescence, ultrafast spectroscopy, optical tweezers, single molecule electrical measurements, quantum dots, and single molecule force microscopy. Both the text and illustrations have been prepared in a clear and accessible style, with exercises (and their solutions) accompanying each chapter.\nThe perfect addition to classic textbooks, this is only source for the really interesting stuff for spicing up standard biophysics courses. As a result, any reader with a basic understanding of biochemistry and/or biophysics will quickly gain an overview of the current technology used in the biophysical analysis of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules and their interactions.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a517b6739315df9918ccd51c883a28e67a2d0f5","amp;dn":"Modern+Biophysical+Chemistry%2C+2E-+Walla+%28Wiley%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a517b6739315df9918ccd51c883a28e67a2d0f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,81,123,103,57,49,93,249,145,140,205,81,200,131,162,142,103,162,208,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
