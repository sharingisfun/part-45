It marks their first line-up change since 1983; guitarist Adrian Smith left the band during the pre-production phase, unhappy with the musical direction it was taking, and only having contributed to one song, &quot;Hooks in You&quot;. Smith was replaced by Janick Gers, who had previously worked with singer Bruce Dickinson on his first solo-album, Tattooed Millionaire, and had also worked with Ian Gillan, former Marillion singer Fish, and New Wave of British Heavy Metal band, White Spirit. \n\nAlthough it received generally mixed to negative reviews, the album peaked at No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart and contains the band's only UK Singles Chart No. 1, &quot;Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter&quot;.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Tailgunner&quot;   \tSteve Harris, Bruce Dickinson \t4:13\n02. \t&quot;Holy Smoke&quot;   \tHarris, Dickinson \t3:47\n03. \t&quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot;   \tHarris \t4:22\n04. \t&quot;Public Enema Number One&quot;   \tDave Murray, Dickinson \t4:03\n05. \t&quot;Fates Warning&quot;   \tMurray, Harris \t4:09\n06. \t&quot;The Assassin&quot;   \tHarris \t4:16\n07.     &quot;Run Silent Run Deep&quot;   \tHarris, Dickinson \t4:34\n08. \t&quot;Hooks in You&quot;   \tDickinson, Adrian Smith \t4:06\n09. \t&quot;Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter&quot;   \tDickinson \t4:42\n10. \t&quot;Mother Russia&quot;   \tHarris \t5:30\n\t\nUS bonus track\n\t\n11. \t&quot;Listen With Nicko!
