But revenge is not simple. As he stalks his wife's betrayers-a chase that takes him from the wild moors of Scotland to the bustling streets of New York City and the darkest bayous of Louisiana-he is also forced to dig further into Helen's past. And he is stunned to learn that Helen may have been a collaborator in her own murder.\n\nPeeling back the layers of deception, Pendergast realizes that the conspiracy is deeper, goes back generations, and is more monstrous than he could have ever imagined-and everything he's believed, everything he's trusted, everything he's understood . . . may be a horrific lie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:702e7affd8c6377eecc9284b5d58ca3ad5618c34","amp;dn":"Cold+Vengeance+-+Douglas+Preston+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"702e7affd8c6377eecc9284b5d58ca3ad5618c34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,46,122,255,216,198,55,126,236,201,40,75,93,88,202,58,213,97,140,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
