All these were carefully prepared for publication by the composer.\n\nIn stark contrast the majority of his lute solos have survived in much less reliable forms. Apart from the two solos that appeared in &quot;A Pilgrimes Solace&quot; and &quot;A Musicall Banquet&quot; and the nine pieces (or ten if you consider &quot;Sir Henry Guilforde his Almaine&quot; to be by him) that are found in &quot;A Varietie of Lute Lessons&quot; published by his son in 1610, his solo lute music has come down to us in sources from all over Europe with little or no direct involvement by Dowland. It is unfortunate that he never fulfilled the promise he gave in &quot;The First Booke of Songes&quot; to &quot;set forth the choicest of all my Lessons in print.&quot;\n\nDowland's solo lute music is extraordinarily varied. It ranges from light, frivolous pieces such as &quot;Mrs. White's Nothing&quot; and &quot;Lady Hundson's Puffe&quot; to profound works expressing the darkest melancholy (&quot;Forlorn Hope Fancy&quot; and &quot;Semper Dolens Semper Dowland.&quot;) His music is characterized by a tunefulness unequalled in contemporary lutenists' output and many of his solos were given texts to become lute songs. One such example is his famous pavane &quot;Lachrimae,&quot; which he published in &quot;The Second Booke of Songes&quot; as &quot;Flow my teares.&quot;\n\nIf you enjoy this torrent then make sure to check out the Renaissance music\nmega torrent:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5789072/Renaissance_Music_Collection_-_Morley__Dowland__Henry_VIII__etc.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5789072/Renaissance_Music_Collection_-_Morley__Dowland__Henry_VIII__etc.&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b50822ce22a39a786d6859d8d05d1d386163046","amp;dn":"John+Dowland+-+The+Complete+Lute+Music+-+Jacob+Lindberg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b50822ce22a39a786d6859d8d05d1d386163046","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,80,130,44,226,42,57,167,134,214,133,157,141,5,209,211,134,22,48,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
