First introduced in 1949 for the United States Air Force, the F-86 featured excellent performance for its day, outstanding handling characteristics, and high adaptability. The Sabre served in a number of NATO-aligned countries and was even produced in Canada. A total of 9,860 Sabres of all variants were produced, some of which are still flying today with private collectors. The F-86F-1 version featured an uprated engine over its predecessors and a larger wing without leading-edge slats.\n\n** FSX only **\n\nFeatures - \n\n- featured model : 39th FIS, &amp;#039;Beautious Butch&amp;#039;\n- stunning realistic texturing with highly detailed weathering, literally every rivet shown\n- full FSX model with all FSX features (bump mapping, self-shadowing, bloom etc)\n- FSX model includes V-C SELF-SHADOWING (effect requires FSX SP2, Vista)\n- highly authentic virtual cockpit with animations and mousable controls\n- authentic all-xml 2D panel, hi-res glazed-effect gauges, custom pop-ups for ECU, autopilot and radios, fully mousable\n- droppable drop tanks, pilot and canopy can be ejected (resulting in loss of control)\n- two seperate flight models for clean and loaded model\n- detailed checklist and performance that precisely matches that of the real aircraft\n- custom effects for turbine glow (3-stage), smoke (startup &amp; in-flight), wingtip and flap contrails\n- high quality soundset included\n- togglable realistic pilot figure\n- animated canopy and entry steps\n- v-c rain effects (FS9 only)\n- source textures included for repainters","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c29747cac390937c282dab117595840dc8fa31cf","amp;dn":"FSX+Alphasim+F-86F+Sabre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c29747cac390937c282dab117595840dc8fa31cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,151,71,202,195,144,147,124,40,45,171,17,117,149,132,13,200,250,49,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
