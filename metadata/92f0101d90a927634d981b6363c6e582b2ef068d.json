No matter how cheap you cannot get that many drivers onto a 4GB DVD ROM\n\nThis is one of those DVDs on EBay and I'm sharing with you all\n\nThe DVD is 1.4GB ISO, simply d/l and mount/burn\n\nI'd post a list but whoever compiled this DVD did a hopeless job of separating the drivers out into anything meaningful, just big directories of .inf and .sys files but no other segmentation.\n\nGive it a go. You never know there might be buried treasure here.\nAt least you didn't pay $4-6 on Ebay for it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92f0101d90a927634d981b6363c6e582b2ef068d","amp;dn":"XP_DRIVERS.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92f0101d90a927634d981b6363c6e582b2ef068d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,240,16,29,144,169,39,99,77,152,27,99,99,198,229,130,178,239,6,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
