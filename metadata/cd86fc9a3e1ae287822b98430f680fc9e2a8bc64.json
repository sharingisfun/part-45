It was to be their biggest hit, reaching number 2 on the UK singles chart. Their debut album, EXPECTING TO FLY--named after a classic Buffalo Springfield song--reached number 1 in the UK album charts in February 1996. Many pundits predicted greater things for the band, although ultimately their lack of originality may be a stumbling block. RETURN TO THE LAST CHANCE SALOON attempted to make a clean break from the style of their debut, but with limited success. The album was also met by a worryingly indifferent commercial response. Their third album, 2000's SCIENCE AND NATURE marked a more successful attempt to retool their sound, although their commercial heyday had passed a dedicated following allowed the band to stay afloat.\n\nPlease seed for others to enjoy. Many thanks. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd86fc9a3e1ae287822b98430f680fc9e2a8bc64","amp;dn":"The+Bluetones+-+Expecting+to+Fly+%26+Science+and+Nature+-320kbps+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd86fc9a3e1ae287822b98430f680fc9e2a8bc64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,134,252,154,62,26,226,135,130,43,152,67,15,104,15,201,226,168,188,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
