It was also released at the same time as a live DVD. Bassist Barry Sparks would depart Nugent's band shortly after, at which time Greg Smith took over.\n\nThis performance was a rare occasion where Nugent used his white Gibson Byrdland, affectionately named the Great White Buffalo, for songs other than GWB.\n\nFLAC\n\nTed Nugent\n\nSweden Rocks\n\n2008\n\nCD\n\n&quot;Stormtroopin'&quot; - 3:39\n&quot;Wango Tango&quot; - 5:50\n&quot;Snakeskin Cowboys&quot; - 6:14\n&quot;Free-for-All&quot; - 3:55\n&quot;Wang Dang Sweet Poontang&quot; - 8:15\n&quot;Rawdogs &amp; Warhogs&quot; - 3:53\n&quot;Soul Man&quot; (Isaac Hayes, David Porter) - 1:22\n&quot;Hey Baby&quot; (Derek St. Holmes) - 4:29\n&quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; - 4:30\n&quot;Still Raising Hell&quot; - 3:20\n&quot;Cat Scratch Fever&quot; - 4:37\n&quot;Stranglehold&quot; - 9:55\n&quot;Great White Buffalo&quot; - 8:26\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e7f12dac1015e29fc15708554faca1f4d8f9cd8","amp;dn":"Ted+Nugent+-+Sweden+Rocks+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e7f12dac1015e29fc15708554faca1f4d8f9cd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,127,18,218,193,1,94,41,252,21,112,133,84,250,202,31,77,143,156,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
