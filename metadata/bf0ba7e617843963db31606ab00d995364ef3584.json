The story involves Stan and Ollie as two musicians attempting to travel by train to Pottsville (presumably Pennsylvania, a very popular vaudeville performance location). It was only their second sound film, but a silent version was also made for cinemas at the time that were not equipped to show talkies.\n\nAlthough not highly regarded among Laurel and Hardy enthusiasts today, Berth Marks is a technically accomplished film considering its production early in the team's sound films. The opening scene - in which Ollie listens patiently to a stationmaster rattling off a long, garbled list of destinations - shows that even at this very early stage the filmmakers were conscious of how sound could be deployed in new comedic ideas.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf0ba7e617843963db31606ab00d995364ef3584","amp;dn":"Laurel+and+Hardy+-+Berth+Marks+%281929%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf0ba7e617843963db31606ab00d995364ef3584","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,11,167,230,23,132,57,99,219,49,96,106,176,13,153,83,100,239,53,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
