And she is literally dazzling, in resplendent costumes (mostly by Pierre Cardin) and radiantly blonde. The music by Michel Legrand is one of his best scores ever, as it sweeps through the film, carrying everything along with two basic themes, one furiously accelerated piano theme, the other a softer, more lilting theme played in different variations, but mostly on the mandolin. It\\'s a movie that sweeps you along, just as fast and unpredictable as a spin on the roulette wheel. This is a film in which \\&quot;black-and-white\\&quot; becomes a dazzling metaphor, so that the sun-drenched exteriors of the south of France are contrasted with the various interiors of hotel rooms and casinos. LA BAIE DES ANGES may seem slight, but only \\&quot;seems\\&quot;: it\\'s one of the most passionate statements on love and faith in the modern cinema, and it\\'s a work of true enchantment. \n(imdb)\n\n\n\nYear: 1963\nDirector: Jacques Demy\nCountry: France\nGenres: Drama, Romance\nCast: Jeanne Moreau, Claude Mann, Paul Guers, Henri Nassiet, AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Certes, Nicole Chollet, Georges Alban, Conchita Parodi, Jacques Moreau, AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Canter, Jean-Pierre Lorrain\nWriting credits: Jacques Demy\nProduced by Paul-Edmond Decharme\nOriginal Music by Michel Legrand\nCinematography by Jean Rabier\nOAR: 1.66:1\nColor: Black and White  \n\n\nUploader comments:\n\nUncompressed DVD-9 included in the Jacques Demy\\'s Complete Boxset (1944-1988).\nBONUS : Le film vu par Mathieu Demy.\n\n[IMG]http://i1193.photobucket.com/albums/aa342/sunshot1000/closetorrent.gif[/IMG]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58e9a73ac7f980193f91c4bb6f9f7860d19b907e","amp;dn":"Jacques+Demy+-+Bay+of+Angels+%28La+Baie+des+Anges%29+1963","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58e9a73ac7f980193f91c4bb6f9f7860d19b907e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,233,167,58,199,249,128,25,63,145,196,187,111,159,120,96,209,155,144,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
