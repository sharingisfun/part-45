Click 'additional information' button and 'Military overview'\n10. Click close button\n\nDone. All pointers are now fetched and you can start using cheats.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuick &amp; important facts about trainer:\n\n* Run Civilization and start a new game before launching trainer\n* Activate pointers before you begin using it\n* When all pointers are fetched, a success note is played.\n* When trainer is launched and waiting for you to go into\n  civilization, if you don't go into civ, it will shut down\n  after 10 seconds automatically or press ESC to cancel.\n* User input cannot exceed 20 million, error note plays if above\n* If using city-culture cheat, remember to sell Amphitheater\n  or else trainer will hang until you do.\n* When using city modifier, remember to buy a science building\n  or else trainer will hang until you do.\n* Tab'ing to the desktop forces trainer to shut down (security)\n* When starting trainer, you'll hear fast midi notes until you go\n  back into civilization, a success note is played when you do\n* Trainer will shut down if olly, cheatengine, windbg, tsearch\n  or similar tools run in the background. (security)\n* Api hook protection, debug protection and data obfuscation\n* If trainer shuts down unexpectedly, you should know why\nFiraxis works continually to invalidate trainers. :)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat happened to the 'Healing' cheat in my old trainer?\n\nI hated that cheat, if it wasn't enough to cheat almost everything in the game\ncheating with the health adds more insanity to the game. I seriously think the\nhealing cheat isn't necessary, will only ruin the game and I hate it to the guts.\nI will never include that cheat again in any of my future trainers.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nExample of using the movement cheat?\n\n1. Press and hold the ALT key.\n2. Type a numeric value using the leftmost side keypad.\n3. Press ALT + F1 to activate movement cheat with this value.\nor press F1 if ALT key is already down at the moment.\n4. Click a unit to apply it.\n\nDone. The procedure is the same with all other cheats.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCoded by DelphiUniverse/CivFart using fasm (flat assembler)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d099dc611ad8135192575a7b798a44b16d119c21","amp;dn":"Civilization+V+Gods+%26amp%3B+Kings+Trainer+%28SidFart%29+1.0.1.705+Beta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d099dc611ad8135192575a7b798a44b16d119c21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,153,220,97,26,216,19,81,146,87,90,123,121,138,68,177,109,17,156,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
