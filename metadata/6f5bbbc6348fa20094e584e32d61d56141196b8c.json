He has decided that everything has to be made by hand from his woodland, and if it not, then it has to be sourced from somebody else's rubbish. Together with a hardy band of friends and experts, Kevin is going to reuse, repurpose and recycle almost all the materials for his bold building in rural Somerset. A place where he can unhook himself from the madness of modern life and live in a different way. Can a simple, more creative life make you happier?\n\n\n\n\n3)  Part 3 \nKevin's cabin is now habitable, but he has yet to add the vital furnishings to turn it into a comfortable home. And more pressingly, he has nothing to cook with. It's time for some fiendishly clever off grid solutions. With Kevin's cabin not connected to electric or gas, he examines a leftfield experiment in north Wales, where they're turning dog poo into methane. And as the cabin will be a place of rest, Kevin decides to make an armchair out of a 1950s tractor seat and also crafts a small lightweight bed from willow.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1944 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 704 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 48mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/kevin-mcclouds-man-made-home&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/kevin-mcclouds-man-made-home&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f5bbbc6348fa20094e584e32d61d56141196b8c","amp;dn":"Ch4+Kevin+McClouds+Man+Made+Home+3of4+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f5bbbc6348fa20094e584e32d61d56141196b8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,91,187,198,52,143,162,0,148,229,132,227,45,97,213,97,65,25,107,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
