Some episodes were produced by Hubbell Robinson. One by Jerry Lewis ( his remake of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; previously uploaded ). This is the only one from Alfred Hitchcock's production company and he also directed it. Although this appears to be a DVD copy the Ford Motors opening theme was removed, but it's complete other than that.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14b3cf0b266a4e90b88286527125b179cca901b2","amp;dn":"FORD+STARTIME+--+a+1960+episode+directed+by+Alfred+Hitchcock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14b3cf0b266a4e90b88286527125b179cca901b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,179,207,11,38,106,78,144,184,130,134,82,113,37,177,121,204,169,1,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
