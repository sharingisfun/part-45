This series contains a collection of papers dealing with issues in both traditional ceramics (i.e., glass, whitewares, refractories, and porcelain enamel) and advanced ceramics. Topics covered in the area of advanced ceramic include bioceramics, nanomaterials, composites, solid oxide fuel cells, mechanical properties and structural design, advanced ceramic coatings, ceramic armor, porous ceramics, and more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1632724d0a27938c3bad7865f7d6d9c8865e35a9","amp;dn":"Ceramic+Materials+for+Energy+Applications+V+-+Josef+Matyas+et+al","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1632724d0a27938c3bad7865f7d6d9c8865e35a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,50,114,77,10,39,147,140,59,173,120,101,247,214,217,200,134,94,53,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
