This two CD set contains a complete service, complete with the priest's secret prayers, unabbrieviated prokeimenon, and an imperial cherubic hymn from the Byzantine Erra.  The language is middle Greek, and the chant arrangements are a mix of the Byzantine erra and the modern.  A must have for lovers of Byzantine Chant.   Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89413a4bb620be48c1781e47cc70cc22317d004d","amp;dn":"Romeiko+Ensemble+-+Divine+Liturgy+Mode+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89413a4bb620be48c1781e47cc70cc22317d004d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,65,58,75,182,32,190,72,193,120,30,71,204,112,204,34,49,125,0,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
