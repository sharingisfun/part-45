Ã¢â‚¬Å“Poisonberry TideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ kicks off this album with a really upbeat, great rock song reminiscent of alternative bands like R.E.M. especially when it comes to riff. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dig On InÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on the other hand has a real CREAM vibe and take us back to those early days of rock, the nasal voice really gives a special touch to the song. These two tracks pretty much sets the tone of the rest of the album though this doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean they all sound exactly the same cause they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, each one has something that makes their unique for example while the second song has this really Eric Clapton meets Ozzy Osbourne vocals while Ã¢â‚¬Å“ShakeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reminds me to Michael White.\n\nProduced by Jim Wirt, the band approached Heavy Reverie a little bit different than their previous five records, which include Buffalo Killers, the Dan Auerbach-produced Let it Ride, 3, Dig. Sow. Love. Grow., and Record Store Day exclusive Ohio Grass. The band has been around since 2006, after the three original Killers dissolved their previous group, garage-rockers Thee Shams.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ab97da03f894098be571ff0f438d6bd1a751648","amp;dn":"Buffalo+Killers+-+Heavy+Reverie+%282014%29+FLAC+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ab97da03f894098be571ff0f438d6bd1a751648","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,185,125,160,63,137,64,152,190,87,31,240,244,56,214,189,26,117,22,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
