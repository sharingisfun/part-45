Russell is rough and tumble reporter looking to get out of the news racket by marrying and becoming a house wife after her divorce from newspaper publisher Grant. Just when she is about to leave town with her husband-to-be the still lovesick Grant drafts her to cover one final breaking news sensation. Along with plenty of laughs and fast paced dialog this film provides a witty and cynical look at news business. There is a slight audio sync problem in the first couple minutes of the film. It is present on the source medium and is very brief.\n\nMPEG-2\n4:3\n720x480\nNTSC\nDVD Ready\nRunning time: 1:31:44\n\nFor more public domain classics visit: iMovies.blogspot.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:455a985c8706c727781d1755b45f96db6cd1b0d3","amp;dn":"His+Girl+Friday+%281940%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"455a985c8706c727781d1755b45f96db6cd1b0d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,90,152,92,135,6,199,39,120,29,23,85,180,95,150,219,108,209,176,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
