One is published by Boom Studios and is some Science Fiction nonsense about a reality TV show in the future. This one is an indie comic but is much better. It totally lives up to its title, with cool art and pretty emotional story. If you like big monkeys with big guns in the Wild West, this is for you.\n\nIf you like the comic, go and buy a copy from the author @ www.sixgungorilla.com, especially seeing as how the dude is only charging $1.99 for it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb1211bdad8010b9932a914878421294e281e821","amp;dn":"Six-Gun+Gorilla%3A+Long+Days+of+Vengeance+%231","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb1211bdad8010b9932a914878421294e281e821","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,18,17,189,173,128,16,185,147,42,145,72,120,66,18,148,226,129,232,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
