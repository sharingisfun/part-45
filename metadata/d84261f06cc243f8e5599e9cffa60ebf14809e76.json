Thereafter, making use of the maps, the main military forces are to be dispatched.\n\nDespite thorough preparations, the operation fails. Most of the advanced helicopters crash. In order to collect information on the reasons for the operation's failure, Ukraine's Security Service send their agent (protagonist - Alexander Degtyarev) into the Zone. From now on everything depends on the player. \n\nThe player must traverse through the Zone and investigate the crash sites. As the player progresses he starts learning how the helicopters were shot down. The climax of the story begins when the player reaches Pripyat to find survivors of the helicopter crashes. The player eventually meets Strelok from the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game (Shadow of Chernobyl) and learns of the secrets behind the Zone.\n\nThe game concludes with the survivors, Strelok, and the player leaving the Zone. Before boarding the helicopter the player is prompted whether he wishes to leave The Zone forever or continue exploring the Zone. If the player decides not to leave the Zone, then the game enters a free-play mode. During free-play mode the player can leave the Zone by NPCs at any time he wants.\n\n\n\nMINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:\n============================\n\nMicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP (Service Pack 2)\nProcessor type: Intel Pentium 4 2.2 Ghz / AMD XP 2200+\n768 MB RAM\n6 GB available hard drive space\n128 MB DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0 compatible card / nVIDIAÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® GeForceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ 5900 / ATI RadeonÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9600 XT\nDirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0 compatible sound card\nKeyboard, Mouse\n\n\n\n\n\n                                ***** enjoy ... *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d84261f06cc243f8e5599e9cffa60ebf14809e76","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+STALKER+-+CALL+OF+PRIPYAT+%5BMULTI-6%5D+Full+Game+directplay+b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d84261f06cc243f8e5599e9cffa60ebf14809e76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,66,97,240,108,194,67,248,229,89,158,156,255,166,14,191,20,128,158,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
