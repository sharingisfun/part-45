His first record, as with the best fusion, created something a little different than just a mixture ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a new style that, surprisingly, remains all his own.\n\nGranted that Latin music has seeped into the mainstream since, but why aren't Van Halen and Metallica listening to this? Where they simmer, Santana boils over.
