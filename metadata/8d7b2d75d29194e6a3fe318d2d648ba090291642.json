And as I mentioned a couple of times in previous threads, I will often volunteer my time (solving computer problems) to others who are perhaps a little less computer savvy than myself.\n\nAs such, I sometimes visit various help websites online.  And if you have ever been to any of those sites yourself, you would have noticed that many times people's questions go unanswered.  And yet when I know the answer, truth be told I just simply can't be bothered to (A) register at the site, and then (B) post the solution.  It sure would be a whole lot easier if I didn't need to register first, in order to post.\n\nThat's a trait of myself that I particularly don't care for.  I wish I had more time, and perhaps more motivation to help out.  But when we need to jump through the hoops of registration to post a simple message, I tend to become a little lazy and even disinterested.\n\nAlong those same lines, every now and again someone will register right here on The Pirate Bay for no other reason than to send me a quick message.  I'm humbled by that for a number of reasons.  But perhaps least of which, it humbles me because I'm not so sure I would be doing the same thing if I were in their position.  Like I said, I become disinterested when it comes to registration.\n\nBut I know there are a lot of you out there who have been downloading these bundles for years.  I know there are a lot of you out there who appreciate this source of music.  And I know there are a lot of you out there who haven't yet registered here on The Pirate Bay because, well simply because you can anonymously download the torrents without registering.\n\nI am dedicating today's bundle to those unregistered people.  Perhaps someday we will all hear from you.  Perhaps someday you will register, and I will get to personally thank you for your involvement in this ministry.  Until then, enjoy the music.\n\nPRAISE &amp; WORSHIP: Allen Asbury, Hillsong, Thirst Worship.  HIP-HOP/RAP: Andy Mineo, EMC Chef, J Han, J Johnson, Kileon, Lank, Ryan Martinez, Yung Saintz.
