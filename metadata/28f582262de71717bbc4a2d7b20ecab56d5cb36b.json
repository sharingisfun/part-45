Rock says he was inspired to make the\n\nfilm when his young daughter asked him, &quot;Daddy, how come I don't\n\nhave good hair?&quot; and he and Stilson examine black America's\n\nobsession with their hair. They visit the Bronner Brothers\n\nInternational Hair Show, an annual trade show for the African-American\n\nhaircare industry which includes fierce competitions among stylists\n\nfrom around the country and demonstrations of new hair products and\n\ntechniques. Along the way, Rock also talks to a number of\n\nAfrican-American luminaries about their hair issues (including Maya\n\nAngelou, Reverend Al Sharpton, Nia Long, Raven Symone, Ice-T, and\n\nPaul Mooney), researches the dangers of many common hair-straightening\n\ntreatments, reveals the surprising expense of regular hair &quot;relaxing&quot;\n\nand weaves, and ponders what the pursuit of straight hair says about\n\nAfrican-American cultural identity. GOOD HAIR received its world\n\npremiere at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodhairmovie.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodhairmovie.net/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1213585/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1213585/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=goodhair.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=goodhair.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Hair&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Hair&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nVideo: 624x352 880 kb/s 23.976fps\n\nAudio: MP3 ABR 134 kb/s Joint Stereo\n\nRuntime: 95 min\n\n\n\nBlured dvd screener studio source\n\n\n\nGreetings to KART3LDVD\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28f582262de71717bbc4a2d7b20ecab56d5cb36b","amp;dn":"Good.Hair.LIMITED.DVDSCR.XviD-ZOOM+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28f582262de71717bbc4a2d7b20ecab56d5cb36b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,245,130,38,45,231,23,23,187,196,162,215,178,14,202,181,109,92,179,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
