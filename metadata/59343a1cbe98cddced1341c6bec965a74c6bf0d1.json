When the town comes under threat from the U.S.-South Korea combined forces, Lee leaves Jeonju along with the Regional Party to join the guerilla unit headquarters in Mt. Yeob-un. Commissioned as a combat platoon leader, Lee leads his men, including Kim Young (Choi Min-soo), on various guerilla missions. In November 1950, the guerilla suppression forces storm their base of operations while virtually everyone is out on a mission. Lee escapes with a military nurse named Park Min-ja (Choi Jin-sil), and the two fall in love. After they overcome various trials and rejoin their unit, however, they are forced to part by their commanding officer. Soon thereafter, Lee is assigned to the Regional Party's guerilla headquarters, where he performs political propaganda missions. In June 1951, he is transferred to the Southern Force. He travels to the rendezvous point in Mt. Jiri, where he participates in full-fledged guerilla operations with Lee Bong-gak (Dokko Young-jae), Kim Hee-sook (Lee Hye-young), and others, under Commander Lee Hyun-sang. The Southern Force achieves a stellar mission record for a while, but the extensive guerilla suppression operation launched in late 1951 endangers the unit and they are forced to make a painful retreat. In the process, Lee Tae, Kim Young, and others end up falling behind, and Lee is finally captured by the suppression forces in March 1952. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59343a1cbe98cddced1341c6bec965a74c6bf0d1","amp;dn":"%E5%8D%97%E9%83%A8%E8%BB%8D%2FNambugun%2F%EB%82%A8%EB%B6%80%EA%B5%B0%2FThe+South+Korean+Army%281990%29%E9%9F%93%E6%88%B0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59343a1cbe98cddced1341c6bec965a74c6bf0d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,52,58,28,190,152,205,220,237,19,65,198,190,201,101,167,76,107,240,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
