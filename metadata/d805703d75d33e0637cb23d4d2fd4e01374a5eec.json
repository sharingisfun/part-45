Claiming it's the &quot;only&quot; way to fix the damn\nproblem.\n\nThis is just ridiculous!\n\nEspecially since Paradox Interactive could have fixed their shit, with\nvery little effort, just like we did. No wonder people perfer a scene\nrelease, rather than a lazy publisher/developer with no respect for\ntheir customers. And remember, we do this because we can, not because\nwe want people to get to play games for free.\n\nWhat bugs us even more is that the same bunch of hoodlums, that we\nmentioned the other day, released a fix to correct the cursor problem.\nA fix have been floating on several boards since we released the game,\nbut these hoodlums have no clue, that they need to do it properly.\n\nRELEASE NOTES\n\nCritically praised by reviewers and gamers alike, King Arthur was\nreceived one of the biggest surprises to emerge on the gaming scene in\n2010. Now the Fantasy/Roleplaying RTS returns in a sequel set to push\nthe boundaries of the genre even further.\n\nOur story begins long after young Arthur pulled the enchanted sword out\nof the stone, united the war-torn land of Britannia, gathered the\nKnights of the Round Table and secured peace in Camelot aided by the\nmight of the Holy Grail. Where legends normally end, King Arthur II\nbegins on its own gruesome tale.\n\nFeatures:\n\nDark fantasy setting. King Arthur is now the Maimed King, trying to\nmend a land torn asunder as he strives to heal himself.\n\nIntense boss fights, where the heroÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forces are pitted against unique\nand terrifying foes.\n\nLose yourself in a stunning story that unfolds over a huge 3D campaign\nmap featuring knightly quests and other special events\n\nWide range of camera control options, revised animations and an\nextensive tutorial creating a more accessible and visually stunning\nexperience\n\nExperience huge real-time battles featuring thousands of soldiers and\nflying fantasy monsters\n\nBattle enemies which employ unique war tactics and cast fantastic\nspells\n\nYour choices will unlock special content, spells and units with plenty\nof new and unique possibilities with every choice\n\nLead major heroes who possess extraordinary powers\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n1.
