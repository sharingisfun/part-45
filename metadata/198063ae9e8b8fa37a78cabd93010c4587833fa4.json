The featured match is Liverpool v Arsenal at Anfield. The crowd inside Anfield outnumbered the audience on BBC Two, only available in London at the time, two to one. With &quot;She Loves You&quot;, the hit song from The Beatles, bursting out of the Anfield PA system, presenter Kenneth Wolstenholme tells viewers: &quot;Welcome to Match of the Day, the first of a weekly series coming to you every Saturday on BBC Two. As you can hear, we're in Beatleville.&quot; Wolstenholme was a former RAF bomber pilot, flying 100 missions in World War Two by the age of 23. He commentated on 23 consecutive FA Cup finals and five World Cups, coining the immortal phrase &quot;they think it's all over. it is now&quot;. \nMatch of the Day was originally intended as a one-off series, a trial run for the 1966 World Cup! \n\nWidescreen, black &amp; white!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:198063ae9e8b8fa37a78cabd93010c4587833fa4","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+-+22nd+August+1964+-+WS+PDTV+X264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"198063ae9e8b8fa37a78cabd93010c4587833fa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,128,99,174,158,139,143,163,122,120,202,189,147,1,12,69,135,131,63,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
