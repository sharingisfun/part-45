This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nOne singer in the countdown has hit the top 10 as a solo, a duo, and a trio, a distinction shared by only Paul McCartney and Diana Ross.\n\nCasey tells the story of the album which holds the record for most weeks on the classical album chart. It is by an artist who started his career as a man and continues today as a woman.\n\nCasey explains how Taoism got started. Its the Tao of Casey.\n\nThen he explains how Kevin Cronin of Reo Speedwagon couldn't go to the mountain so he got the mountain to come to him.\n\nA band formerly known as Mudcrutch has their eighth top 40 hit.\n\nThis countdown has the first medley in three years to hit the chart.\n\nThe city with the longest name on the planet, 167 letters, has a song about it in this countdown.\n\n40: Lucky In Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mick Jagger\n39: Oh Girl Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Boy Meets Girl\n38: Show Some Respect Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tina Turner\n37: That Was Yesterday Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Foreigner\n36: A View To A Kill Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Duran Duran\n35: Nightshift Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Commodores\n34: Voices Carry Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœTil Tuesday\n33: Celebrate Youth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rick Springfield\n32: Invisible Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Alison Moyet\n31: Would I Lie To You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Eurythmics\n30: Raspberry Beret Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Prince And The Revolution\n29: Ã¢â‚¬ËœTil My Baby Comes Home Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Luther Vandross\n28: All She Wants To Do Is Dance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Don Henley\n27: The Search Is Over Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Survivor\nLDD: Help - Beatles\n26: Never Ending Story Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Limahl\n25: Obsession Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Animotion\n24: Sussudio Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Phil Collins\n23: SmugglerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blues Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Glenn Frey\n22: Say YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Wrong Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Julian Lennon\n21: New Attitude Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Patti Labelle\n20: One Lonely Night Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Reo Speedwagon\n19: Angel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Madonna\n18: DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Come Around Here No More Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers\n17: Walking On Sunshine Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Katrina And The Waves\n16: Rhythm Of The Night Ã¢â‚¬â€œ DeBarge\n15: Just A Gigolo/I AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Got Nobody Ã¢â‚¬â€œ David Lee Roth\n14: We Are The World Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Usa For Africa\n13: In My House Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mary Jane Girls\n12: Heaven Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bryan Adams\n11: Fresh Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kool &amp; The Gang\n10: Things Can Only Get Better Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Howard Jones\n9: Some Like It Hot Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Power Station\n8: Suddenly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Billy Ocean\n7: One Night In Bangkok Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Murray Head\n6: Crazy For You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Madonna\nLDD: Through The Years Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kenny Rogers\n5: Smooth Operator Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sade\n4: Axel F Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Harold Faltermeyer\n3: Everybody Wants To Rule The World Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tears For Fears\n2: DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t You (Forget About Me) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Simple Minds\n1: Everything She Wants - Wham\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2686a0b73fdc4fc38dacc78750bee40804f8c1f","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1985_May_25th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2686a0b73fdc4fc38dacc78750bee40804f8c1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,104,106,11,115,253,196,252,56,218,204,120,117,11,238,64,128,79,140,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
