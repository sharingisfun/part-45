First published in 1957, the story begins with Leckie enlisting in the United States Marines shortly after the 1941 Attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe 2010 HBO mini-series The Pacific was adapted in large part from Helmet for My Pillow, along with Eugene Sledge's With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa and the personal story of Medal of Honor recipient Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone.\n\nSynopsis\n\nBeginning with boot camp in MCRD Parris Island, South Carolina, the story follows Leckie through basic training and then to New River, North Carolina where he is briefly stationed, and follows him to the Pacific.\n\nLeckie is assigned to the 1st Marine Division and is deployed to Guadalcanal, northern Australia, New Guinea, Cape Gloucester, before being evacuated with wounds from the island of Peleliu. Helmet for My Pillow is told from an enlisted man's point of view; a reprint edition stated the book was about &quot;the booze, the brawling, the loving on 72-hour liberty, the courageous fighting and dying in combat as the U.S. Marines slugged it out, inch by inch, across the Pacific.&quot;\n\nAdaptations\n\nIn April 2007, it was announced that E.B. Sledge's With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa, along with Helmet for My Pillow, would form the basis for the HBO miniseries The Pacific, the successor to Band of Brothers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0e864de87649c68209059271a03bc6d8e064b96","amp;dn":"Robert+Leckie+-+Helmet+for+My+Pillow+%28mp3+unab.%29+WWII+Marine+Mem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0e864de87649c68209059271a03bc6d8e064b96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,232,100,222,135,100,156,104,32,144,89,39,26,3,188,109,142,6,75,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
