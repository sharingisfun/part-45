Like Moore's prior album Wild Frontier, this album contains elements of his celtic roots.\nThe track &quot;Led Clones&quot; with Ozzy Osbourne on lead vocals, pokes fun at bands such as Kingdom Come and Whitesnake who were quite popular at the time and were based on a Led Zeppelin type sound and image. Moore again pays tribute to the memory of his long time friend and colleague Phil Lynott with the song &quot;Blood Of Emeralds&quot;.\n&quot;After The War&quot; is the last conventional hard rock album by Moore until Dark Days in Paradise (1997); the next album marked a departure into blues. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:089c1397b5cf7539701a8470511a38a64ecee6e6","amp;dn":"Gary+Moore+-+After+The+War+-+Flac+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"089c1397b5cf7539701a8470511a38a64ecee6e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,156,19,151,181,207,117,57,112,26,132,112,81,26,56,166,78,206,230,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
