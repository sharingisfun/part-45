I&amp;#039;ve included the playlist, cue sheet and images of the cd, cover and back.  If you burn this to a cd and have a program that will leave out the gaps, you might want to use that option; a couple of the tracks are meant to be listened to as one.  I haven&amp;#039;t quite figured out all the ins and outs of gap manipulation in EAC yet.  By the way, SinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ad&amp;#039;s version of Nirvana&amp;#039;s &quot;All Apologies&quot; is really great, IMHO.\n\n01. Germaine (0:38)\n02. Fire On Babylon (5:12)\n03.
