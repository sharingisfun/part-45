Black Hawk, San Francisco, September 22 (# 3), 23 (# 2) &amp; 24 (# 1, 4), 1959. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Originally released as four LPs, the Shelly Manne Quintet's three days at San Francisco's Black Hawk club is now documented on five CDs. The third volume adds a second (and longer) version of &quot;Whisper Not&quot; to the original rendition, Cole Porter's &quot;I Am in Love&quot; and the spontaneous 18-minute &quot;Black Hawk Blues.&quot; Considering how much music was documented, it is fortunate that trumpeter Joe Gordon, tenorman Richie Kamuca, pianist Victor Feldman, bassist Monty Budwig and drummer Shelly Manne were in top form for this enjoyable gig. The music is high-quality straightforward and uncomplicated bebop. ~ AllMusic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nOf the five volumes of Shelly Manne's &quot;At The Blackhawk,&quot; Volume 3 is the most laidback. The gorgeous &quot;Am In Love&quot; leads off the album, followed by the smooth call and response from Richie Kamuca (tenor sax) and Joe Gordon (trumpet) on &quot;Whisper Not.&quot; The lengthy, soulful tribute to the San Francisco club &quot;Black Hawk Blues&quot; completes the album. The CD adds an excellent alternate take of &quot;Whipser Not.&quot; As with the other Blackhawk volumes, the band rules, the sound is incerdible and the atmosphere is unparalleled. Any serious jazz fan should get all five of these live recordings. You won't be dissappointed. ~ Michael B.
