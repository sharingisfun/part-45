A hardened veteran of the wars in the Low Countries, he has come home to England to seek revenge on the man who left him for dead and scarred him for life.\n\nDevil's Charge (The Civil War Chronicles, #2): England stands divided: king against Parliament, town against country, brother against brother. For Captain Stryker, scarred hero of a dozen wars, the rights and wrongs of the cause mean little. His loyalties are to his own small band of comrades - and to Queen Henrietta MariaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beautiful and most deadly agent, Lisette Gaillard...\n\nHunter's Rage (The Civil War Chronicles, #3): Posted to the hostile territory of Dartmoor, Captain Innocent Stryker and his men are attacked by an elite cavalry unit commanded by the formidable Colonel Gabriel Wild and suffer heavy losses. Stryker has already clashed once with Wild, and the Roundhead has sworn to seek his revenge...\n\nAssassin's Reign (The Civil War Chronicles, #4): The forces of King Charles are victorious; their Parliamentarian enemies in deep crisis. In the west, the crucial port city of Bristol has fallen, and Royalist eyes fall quickly upon neighbouring Gloucester. Its walls are weak, its garrison under strength, and its governor - Sir Edward Massie - suspected of harbouring sympathy for the King.\n\nHighwayman - Ironside (The Civil War Chronicles novella): A nation reeling from the turmoil of bloody civil war. An island in the iron grip of Oliver Cromwell's Protectorate. The forces of King Charles have been utterly defeated. The sovereign is dead, his supporters beaten, humiliated and scattered. But it is not just former Cavaliers who find themselves hounded by the new regime. Many of those who fought for Parliament have fallen foul of the oppressive rule of the Major-Generals.\n\nStryker and the Angels of Death (The Civil War Chronicles novella): It is the autumn of 1630, and Innocent Stryker has completed his first year as a soldier. But life as part of a regiment of mercenaries is hard and cruel, while the brutal war destroying mainland Europe has shown him horrors he never thought possible. Stryker has few allies, and much to prove.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25a8a524641a76425ee27ab2b9cbc7a85f4bfcd5","amp;dn":"+The+Civil+War+Chronicles+by+Michael+Arnold","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25a8a524641a76425ee27ab2b9cbc7a85f4bfcd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,168,165,36,100,26,118,66,94,226,122,178,185,203,199,168,95,75,252,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
