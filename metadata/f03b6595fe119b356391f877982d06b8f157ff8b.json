We're Gonna Make It\n02. I'm A Man\n03. Baby, Don't Worry\n04. From Above\n05. Fighting Is Easy\n06. I Was Young\n07. Ramblin' On My Mind\n08. Nightmares\n09. I Just Can't Wait\n10. Ann\n11. Sexy Legs\n12. Happiness -&gt; \n13. Bring It On Home -&gt; band intros -&gt;\n14. Spoonful\n15. You're The Victor\nFirst Encore :::\n16. It Came To Me -&gt;\n17. The Life I Live\t\t\nSecond Encore :::\n18. I'm A Man (again!)//\n\nTotal Time ::: 1:29:01\n\n::: VERY fine low generation crisp AUD. Check samples for self-trajectory assessment or intial levitation inducement.\n::: Warts: Not many! #13 has occasional clapping &amp; a (carefully edited) tapeflip. #18 cuts. Surely missed some dullspots but fixed most of them.\n::: Frenz Fried &amp; De Frimo's was the opening act. \n::: &quot;Q65&quot; is aka &quot;Q'65&quot; &amp; aka &quot;Q 65&quot;. \n::: Den Hague is Den Haag in Dutch &amp; sometimes appears that way in English. Paard van Troje is Dutch for The Trojan Horse.\n::: It seems most likely the taper moved to a new location before the encore. But 'tis possible the last 3 songs are a different show or set.\n::: I would REALLY love it if some folks would upload some more Q65. For SURE it is out there. We've only had 2 here that I know of, '88 &amp; '90 reunions. Where's the early stuff? For that matter, it would be wonderful if some people could upload more unissued Dutch beat/garage/psych &amp; folk here. We have seen a few things but barely scratched the surface of what must be around. Holland has always been loaded with very hip music freaks &amp; cool radio &amp; TV. How about more Outsiders or some Tax Free, Farmers Union, After Tea, Opo, Group 1850, Bintangs, Cargo, Motions (psych vintage) (just to mention a few!). 'twould be most appreciated in many quarters, I'm sure.\n\nRecording Information ::: unknown stereo cassette recorder (and seems like 2 microphones) -&gt; master stereo audience cassette(s) -&gt; 1 or 2 analog cassette generations &gt; 2nd or 3rd generation Maxell XLII-90 cassette, Dolby off.\n\nPlayback 2014-01-06 ::: 2nd or 3rd generation Maxell XLII-90 cassette on Nakamichi 680ZX cassette deck, Dolby off, azimuth &amp; speed adjusted (pitched!) for individual recording, heads cleaned &amp; demagnetized -&gt; Sony Linear PCM Recorder PCM-M10 (LPCM 44.10kHz/16bit WAV files) -&gt; computer -&gt; Audacity (normalisation to remove DC offset, channel/phase alignment, fades, manual one-at-a-time glitch / dropout / bump / pop / click / dullspot repairs, volume adjustments, further speed fixes if necessary, NO equalisation) -&gt; CD Wave (track splits) -&gt; flacs (Trader's Little Helper) -&gt; yr ears. First uploaded week of 2014-01-11.\n\nLine-up - CONFIRMED :::  Joop Roelofs - electric guitar, vocals // Joop van Nimwegen - electric guitar (ex-Finch) // Tommy Steele (sp?) - electric bass(?) // Beer Klaasse - drums // UNCONFIRMED ::: Willem Bieler(?) - lead vocals, harmonica, flute(?) // Rene van Spanje? - keyboards (#5 &amp; ?) // Rick Finck(?) - electric bass.\n \nNothing here ever commercially released to my knowledge. If I'm wrong, please advise &amp; I'll take the offending trax offline.\n\nCoolSonics 293 ::: Thanks to the original taper &amp; traders! ::: Corrections welcome ::: Here's one to shake that beat-infected Duke of Sexau out of his winter doldrums &amp; dancin' in his room. One of the first conversations we ever had was about the 60s Dutch beat/psych scene. Aside from about 3 songs in the middle of the set here, this one is pretty damn fine &amp; rockin'. OK, it doesn't have versions of &quot;Love Is Such A Good Thing&quot; or &quot;I'm Glad&quot;, but perhaps by '85 it was hard to sing &quot;We make a big joint &amp; smoke then we go to bed &amp; make love&quot;. Who knows. Makes me happy listening to this one no matter what. Excellent band. Hope you also ENJOY it!\n\nKudos to Zongo for life support, Lochner for mikes&amp;more &amp; Fast Freddie for runnin' Video Dick's Record Emporium with the bathroom office full of tape decks.

Mountains of gratitude to Davmar, D.White, Sanchez, Elliot, The Florida Kid, Kloiber, Zingg, JTW, Bershaw, Boston Gold, Dixon, Moore, Gough &amp; SO many more for all that collecting &amp; sharing...
