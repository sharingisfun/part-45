This is the kind of record guaranteed to feed\nthe needs of the multi-generational Skynyrd Nation, and continue the renewed vigor the band exhibited with their previous album, 2009's God &amp; Guns. For the passionate, longtime fans of the band, this is Skynyrd at the top of their game, complete with instantly memorable songs, more hooks than a tackle box, and a blistering three-guitar attack at full power.\n\nLed by core members Gary Rossington (guitar), Johnny Van Zant (vocals) and Rickey Medlocke (guitar), along with longtime drummer Michael Cartellone, Skynyrd has\nrecorded an album that continues to build on the legacy that began over 35 years ago in Jacksonville, Florida. Joining them in the studio and on the road are new bassist Johnny Colt (Black Crowes, Train) guitarist Mark &quot;Sparky&quot; Matejka (a &quot;Nashville cat, just a pickin' fool,&quot; according to Rossington), and keyboardist Peter Keys, who replaced Powell on the God &amp; Guns tour.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic. HHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Last of A dyin' breed                                [03:52]\n02.One day at A time                                    [03:46]\n03.Homegrown                                            [03:41]\n04.Ready to fly                                         [05:26]\n05.Mississippi blood                                    [02:58]\n06.Good teacher                                         [03:07]\n07.Something to live for                                [04:29]\n08.Life's twisted                                       [04:34]\n09.Nothing comes easy                                   [04:14]\n10.Honey hole                                           [04:35]\n11.Start livin' life again                              [04:23]\n________\n45:05 min\n 70,8 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
