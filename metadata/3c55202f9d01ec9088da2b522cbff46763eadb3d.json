Whatever the case, modern audiences will latch onto Susan Lennox not because of its cumbersome title but because of its one-time-only pairing of Garbo and Clark Gable. Fleeing an arranged marriage with Alan Hale, Sr.,, Swedish farmer&amp;#039;s daughter Garbo takes temporary refuge in a cabin in the woods, occupied by engineer Gable. Though it is love at first sight, Garbo hastily runs out of Gable&amp;#039;s life when her uncle and her betrothed show up. Again a fugitive, Garbo joins a seedy carnival, becoming the kept woman of carney owner John Miljan. By chance, she is reunited with Gable, who spurns her because of her tawdry station in life. Years pass: Garbo has worked her way up the courtesan ladder, becoming the mistress of politician Hale Hamilton. This relationship comes to a sudden halt thanks to Hamilton&amp;#039;s muckraking enemies, so it&amp;#039;s back to the road for Garbo, who by now will settle for no man but her long-lost Gable. The protagonists finally manage bury the past in the jungle community where the drink-sodden Gable has retreated to &quot;lose himself.&quot; Greta Garbo&amp;#039;s performance in Susan Lennox: Her Fall and Rise is up to standard, but Clark Gable seems extremely uncomfortable, almost as if suffering an impacted molar. The film was adapted by four screenwriters from a novel by David Graham Phillips.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022453/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022453/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\tGreta Garbo\t... \tSusan Lenox\n\n\tClark Gable\t... \tRodney Spencer\n\tJean Hersholt\t... \tKarl Ohlin\n\tJohn Miljan\t... \tBurlingham\n\tAlan Hale\t... \tJeb Mondstrum\n\nA LITTLE NOISY\n==============\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:16:22\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 792 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,09 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nENJOY  AND  SEED\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c55202f9d01ec9088da2b522cbff46763eadb3d","amp;dn":"Susan+Lenox+%281931%29+Greta+Garbo%2C+Clark+Gable.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c55202f9d01ec9088da2b522cbff46763eadb3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,85,32,47,157,1,236,144,136,218,43,82,44,191,244,103,99,234,219,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
