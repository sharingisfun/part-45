Two thousand miles away, J. Goldberg hears these very scripts whispered into her sleep by her pet ferret, devoid of any real direction beyond the dialog. Goldberg awakens to find that she has illustarted these scenes.\n\nIn Jellyfist, two artists battle with interpretation, however absurd the intent or outcome, with running commentary from the creators on just how wrong or right it&amp;#039;s all gone. The first book published as a result of ferret-aided, carved-kitten-transmitted telepathy, Jellyfist&amp;#039;s collection of highly important nonsense just might change your opinion of almost all known things. This Full color comic will have production values and bindings far beyond what the content would dictate.\n\n\nother comics by Jhonen Vasquez: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4132902/Jhonen_Vasquez_Collection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4132902/Jhonen_Vasquez_Collection&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ffbc76a3c5e421b04523d76419dc0e179949610","amp;dn":"Jellyfist+%28Jhonen+Vasquez%2C+Jenny+Goldberg%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ffbc76a3c5e421b04523d76419dc0e179949610","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,251,199,106,60,94,66,27,4,82,61,118,65,157,192,225,121,148,150,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
