This book focuses on all aspects of NMR including classic methods, modern techniques, practical advice for execution of the NMR experiment, theory, and more. For practicing NMR spectroscopists who want a better understanding of their subject, professors who want a wider knowledge of NMR, preparative (synthetic) organic chemists in industry who want to have more information about how to prove the structures of the compounds they make, and analytical chemists in industry who actually carry out the experiments and want a better understanding of what they are doing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e68fc07fb8337690a2b2e291a9c96b7556815bf","amp;dn":"Nuclear+Magnetic+Resonance+Spectrocopy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e68fc07fb8337690a2b2e291a9c96b7556815bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,104,252,7,251,131,55,105,10,43,46,41,26,156,150,183,85,104,21,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
