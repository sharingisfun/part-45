Luckily, shiny new technologies come along all the time that can reignite that interest, and Mac OS X is chock full of shiny stuff.\n\nObjective-C is a programming language that blends CÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s speed and ubiquity with an elegant object-oriented environment and provides a buzzword-laden cornucopia of programming good times. Objective-C is the gateway drug for many of AppleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s niftiest technologies, such as the Cocoa toolkit and the iPhone SDK. Once youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve mastered the Objective-C language, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re well on your way to conquering the rest of the platform. And from there, you can try to take over the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbbe94f692c4efd0fdf6278353698c3093b8f6fa","amp;dn":"Learn+Objective-C+on+the+Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbbe94f692c4efd0fdf6278353698c3093b8f6fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,190,148,246,146,196,239,208,253,246,39,131,83,105,140,48,147,184,246,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
