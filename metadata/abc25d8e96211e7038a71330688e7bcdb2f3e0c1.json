I have over 350 of anomalies but limited it to about 75.\n\nI am 100% convinced there is at the very least ruins of structures, mining and equipment. And at the best guess a continued existence of races &quot;fixing&quot; their craft (the moon). To me I believe a huge battle took place on this artificial craft which can be seen by the bizarre and odd craters that look 'blown-out' like the glass domes protecting these huge crater cities have been turned to dust.\n\nThere is so much about the moon that can not be explained, that it can become an obsession like a 911 truther that gets their first taste of reality - you just want to hunt down more and more info. Where do you go? Obviously not NASA.\n________________________________________________\nDon Wilson - Our Mysterious Spaceship Moon\n\nGeorge Leonard - Somebody Else Is On The Moon\n\nFred Steckling - We Discovered Alien Bases on the Moon\n\nAnd look out for the old NASA 1967-9175 publications (when NASA was semi-legit) and photo books of the moon from that time.\n________________________________________________\n\nOh yeah you can view these photos here : http://ser.sese.asu.edu/LO/index.html\n\nAnd if anyone has a link to the same size and quality of the other LO pics - PLEASE post them here so I can view some more. Perhaps I should ask NASA for a pay rise? :P\n\n****new Moon Anomalies photos here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5180598\n\n....enjoy!\n\n:)\n\nwatchZEITGEISTnow","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abc25d8e96211e7038a71330688e7bcdb2f3e0c1","amp;dn":"NASA+LUNAR+ORBITER+MOON+ANOMALIES+SOURCE+MIXED+by+watchZEITGEIST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abc25d8e96211e7038a71330688e7bcdb2f3e0c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,194,93,142,150,33,30,112,56,167,19,48,104,142,123,205,178,243,224,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
