This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\nWARNING: \n\nIf you limit your upload speed during the download FOR WHATEVER REASON, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be kicked-out for good. I am sick and tired not only of Hit&amp;Run, but of 90% who think IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m some kind of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfree launchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ downloading service. NO ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ITÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S ABOUT SHARING. If you do not want or can or care to share, please, go someplace else. Consider this as one friendly warning. \n\nIMPORTANT: Torrents, especially of UK shows, are under constant and coordinated attack from British-based IP numbers. If you see number of peers with very, very similar address block them all (block range) with your firewall.\nTheir MO is called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbyte-thrashersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½; they aggressively pull bytes from normal peers, causing other ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnormalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ peers to tag you as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œuncooperativeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ since all newer torrent programs have built-in Friend or Foe mechanism. \nNormal clients receive nothing from you (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“cause you gave packets to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgremlinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t give you back any byte ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ simple as that. \nCompanies currently pay agencies and individuals to starve us to death (byte-wise and otherwise). Do not let them to get richer, and let us just to wave to their Jags, Porschs and yachts\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:540fd15481c88e64f6a70b0a9c9ba5bba06ecc19","amp;dn":"White.Collar.S01E09.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"540fd15481c88e64f6a70b0a9c9ba5bba06ecc19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,15,209,84,129,200,142,100,246,167,11,10,156,155,165,187,160,110,204,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
