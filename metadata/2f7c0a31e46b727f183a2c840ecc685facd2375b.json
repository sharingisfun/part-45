This incredible series treats viewers to the latest and loftiest advances in cosmological thought in true down-to-earth Hawking fashion. The series presents an intergalactic detective story, rich with mystery, unexpected twists and astonishing revelations.\n\nVolume 1: The Big Bang\nProgram One: Seeing Is Believing - Today we take for granted many things about the universe - that the Earth is round, that we orbit the sun. But these things are not obvious - our knowledge today is built on the foundations laid down by thousands of years of scientific inquiry and ingenuity. This program explores mathematics and how it revolutionized our view of the universe.\nProgram Two: The Big Bang - Our sun at the center of our solar system is just one star among billions in the Milky Way galaxy. Around us are billions and billions of other galaxies. Where could this entire universe come from? Was it always this way or did the universe have a beginning? The church has always believed that the universe came from a moment of creation - a time when the universe began. Meanwhile, scientists developed two theories: the Big Bang and the Steady State theories.\n\n\nDATOS DEL DVD\n\nSISTEMA: PAL\n\nAUDIO: EspaÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±ol 2.0, InglÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©s 2.0\n\nSUBTÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½TULOS: EspaÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±ol, InglÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©s\n\nRELACION DE ASPECTO: 1.33.1  4:3\n\nINFO EXTRA: MenÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âºs interactivos, Acceso directo a escenas, BiografÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­a, GalerÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â­a fotogrÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡fica.\n   INCLUYE CARÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½TULA\nMÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½TODO DE RIPEO\n\nFORMATO: DVD5 =&gt; DVD5\n\nCOMPRESIÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½N: Sin CompresiÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³n.
