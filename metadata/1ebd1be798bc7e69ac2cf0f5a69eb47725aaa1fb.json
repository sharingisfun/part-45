At least, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the legend the townspeople have always believed. In truth, the Boxtrolls are a community of lovable oddballs who are raising as one of their own an abandoned and orphaned human boy named Eggs. When the Boxtrolls are targeted by a villainous exterminator who is bent on eradicating them, Eggs must venture aboveground to save them, where he teams with an adventurous young girl to save not only the Boxtrolls but the soul of Cheesebridge. \n\nDirector: Anthony Stacchi, Graham Annable\n\nActors: Ben Kingsley, Isaac Hempstead-Wright, Elle Fanning, Jared Harris, Toni Collette, Nick Frost, Richard Ayoade, Tracy Morgan, Simon Pegg\n\nGenre: Family\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ebd1be798bc7e69ac2cf0f5a69eb47725aaa1fb","amp;dn":"The+Boxtrolls.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%232+%5BHD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ebd1be798bc7e69ac2cf0f5a69eb47725aaa1fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,189,27,231,152,188,126,105,172,44,240,245,166,158,180,119,37,170,161,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
