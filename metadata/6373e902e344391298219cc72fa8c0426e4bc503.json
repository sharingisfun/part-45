A quartet session recorded in collaboration with bassist Ron Matthewson, pianist Mike Pyne, and drummer Tony Levin, the album's seven titles are all Hayes' originals, and stretch out in a series of directions spanning from ballads to blues. Hayes' tenor sax crackles with startling energy and power, achieving maximum velocity on the scalding opener &quot;Dear Johnny B,&quot; written in honor of late drummer Johnny Butts. Most remarkable of all is the title cut, which forces Hayes outside his modernist comfort zone to embrace the improvisational spirit.
