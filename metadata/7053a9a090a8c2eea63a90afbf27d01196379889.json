The sons still live with the parents so they must now share a room. Initial antipathy threatens the household's peace and the parents' relationship. \n\nDad lays down the law: both slackers have a week to find a job. Out of the job search and their love of music comes a pact that leads to friendship but more domestic disarray compounded by the boys' sleepwalking. \n\nHovering nearby are Brennan's successful brother and his lonely wife: the brother wants to help sell his step-father's house, the wife wants Dale's attention, and the newlyweds want to retire and sail the seven seas. Can harmony come from the discord?\n\n\n\n\n\nwww.torrengine.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7053a9a090a8c2eea63a90afbf27d01196379889","amp;dn":"Step+Brothers+%282008%29+DvDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7053a9a090a8c2eea63a90afbf27d01196379889","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,83,169,160,144,168,194,238,166,58,144,175,191,39,208,17,150,55,152,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
