Hailed as a masterpiece when it was first exhibited in France in 1858, the photograph is accompanied here by newly commissioned color photographs by noted photographer Stephen Shore. In a provocative essay the author discusses the history of the photograph in the context of attitudes of the day toward photography and photographic exhibitions, outlines the influences on Silvy, and examines his eventual influence on others.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:148669c7b5f3714660c4c8f7ba9bcd5a97644a00","amp;dn":"Camille+Silvy+-+River+Scene%2C+France+%28Art+Ebook+-+Photography%29.pd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"148669c7b5f3714660c4c8f7ba9bcd5a97644a00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,134,105,199,181,243,113,70,96,196,200,247,186,155,205,90,151,100,74,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
