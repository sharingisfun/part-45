I decided to reupload it since his own torrent went down awhile ago and I was one of the last able people to grab it, so I'm hoping he won't kill me if he minds :P  But if so, by all means I'll take it off here ASAP.\n\nThis upload includes all 3 expansions, plus the highly unnecessary (but funny as hell) Cuss Pack, and it should run on most PC's with minimum or no lag. It was released by Xatrix Entertainment about a year after Duke Nukem 3D and designed on the same Build engine, receiving mostly fair to moderate critic reviews.\n\n\nHow to Install:\n\n1.) Open with WinRar or 7zip and extract wherever.\n2.) In the extracted folder, configure sound &amp; video with the &quot;Setup Redneck Rampage&quot; BAT files.\n3.) Click on any of the &quot;Play Redneck Rampage&quot; BAT files to launch the game, and enjoy :)\n\nAnd I personally haven't noticed much significance between the regular BAT's, or the &quot;bMouse&quot; BAT's, but maybe they'll make a difference for you guys, IDK :/\n\nEnjoy and seed :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce170b4f0d7e7f201a52bb8be940f74cddd80f61","amp;dn":"Redneck+Rampage+Family+Reunion%2C+DosBox+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce170b4f0d7e7f201a52bb8be940f74cddd80f61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,23,11,79,13,126,127,32,26,82,187,139,233,64,247,76,221,216,15,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
