Michael Jackson \nsang it a cappella during his 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. \n \nMusic video \nThe music video for &quot;Who Is It&quot; was directed by David Fincher (&amp;#039;Alien 3&amp;#039;, \n&amp;#039;Panic Room&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Fight Club&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Seven&amp;#039;). The video is set in a neo-chrome \nblade-runner-like landscape, where surfaces reflect light and denote luxury \nin all it&amp;#039;s splendor. We see Michael Jackson as a suffering recluse who has \ncome to the conclusion that his girlfriend is cheating. He finds a platinum \nbusiness card with the name &amp;#039;Alex&amp;#039; seemingly confirming that she is cheating \nwith this person who&amp;#039;s name is on the card. As the video progresses, we learn \nthat the girlfriend is working for a secret exclusive billionaire-boys-club \nescort agency. Her identity and visual appearence is changed regularly, confirmed \nby the platinum business cards she presents to each client as the nights go on. \nThis reveals that the name &amp;#039;Alex&amp;#039; on the card found by Jackson is one of her \naliases and is not a secret lover. When she senses that something is wrong and \ndefies her employees to run back to Jacksons home to find him, she finds Jackson&amp;#039;s \nassistant at the door who reveals that Jackson has left and probably for good. \nThe assistant hands her a collection of her alias business cards revealing that \nher secret is out and that she has been exposed. Devastated, she is forced to \nreturn submissively back to her ruthless employees and continue on as a high \nclass prostitite. The video ends with a broken Michael Jackson flying off in \nhis private jet. \n \nMP3: \nMichael Jackson - Who Is It.mp3 \nVariable Bitrate : 254 Kbps \nFrequency : 44100 \nChannels : 2 J-Stereo \nEncoder : Lame 3.96 Extreme Presets \n \nVideo Clip \n--- File Information --- \nZrodlo-Source: DVD \nNazwa pliku - File Name: Michael Jackson - Who Is It [SyNtEr].avi \nWielkosc pliku- File Size (in bytes): 77,889,480 \n--- Container Information --- \nTyp pliku - Base Type: AVI(.AVI), Subtype: OpenDML (AVI v2.0), \nTotal System Bitrate (kbps): 0 \nInterleave (in ms): 40, Preload (in ms): 480 \nNumber of Audio Streams: 1 \nVideo: 52.7 MB (71.05%) \nAudio: 21.0 MB (28.33%) \nAVI Overhead: 471 KB (0.62%) \n--- Video Information --- \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;): H264, Video Codec Name: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC \nCzas - Duration (hh:mm:ss): 6:33.880 \nKlatki - Frame Count: 9847 \nObraz Szer x Wys - Size (pixels): 688 x 304 \nStorage Aspect Ratio(&quot;SAR&quot;)&quot;: 2.263 \nPixel Aspect Ratio (&quot;PAR&quot;): 1.000 \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;): 2.263 \nFrames Per Second: 25.000 \nPics Per Second: 25.000 \nVideo Bitrate (kbps): 1124 \nKodowanie - Type(&quot;MPEG-4/B-VOP/QPel/GMC/NVOP/H264): ///// \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame: 0.215&quot; \n--- Audio Information --- \nAudio: Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3, Audio alignment: Split \nAudio: Sample Rate (Hz): 48000, Bitrate(kbps): 448, Bitrate Type: CBR, Channel Count: 6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a14350043f5d88b9e9af7901021fa124ce100742","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+-+Who+Is+It+%5BDVDRip-SyNtEr%5D+%5BAC3%5D+%5BH264%5D+%5BSub%2BPL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a14350043f5d88b9e9af7901021fa124ce100742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,67,80,4,63,93,136,185,233,175,121,1,2,31,161,36,206,16,7,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
