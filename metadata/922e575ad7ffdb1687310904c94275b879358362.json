That 20 percent of our time accounts for 80 percent of the work we accomplish? The 80/20 Principle shows how we can achieve much more with much less effort, time, and resources, simply by identifying and focusing our efforts on the 20 percent that really counts. Although the 80/20 principle has long influenced today's business world, author Richard Koch reveals how the principle works and shows how we can use it in a systematic and practical way to vastly increase our effectiveness, and improve our careers and our companies.\n\n\nThe unspoken corollary to the 80/20 principle is that little of what we spend our time on actually counts. But by concentrating on those things that do, we can unlock the enormous potential of the magic 20 percent, and transform our effectiveness in our jobs, our careers, our businesses, and our lives.\n\n\n\nEnglish | ISBN: 0385491743 | 288 pages | EPUB | 3,3 MB \n\n\nplease seed and share..............\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:922e575ad7ffdb1687310904c94275b879358362","amp;dn":"The+Secret+to+Achieving+More+with+Less+By+Richard+Koch.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"922e575ad7ffdb1687310904c94275b879358362","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,46,87,90,215,255,219,22,135,49,9,4,201,66,117,184,121,53,131,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
