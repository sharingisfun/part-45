The military promises it's the best fighter jet available, but some critics are saying it's a turkey hatched from a bad idea: a do-it-all plane that might not do anything well-at-all.\n\nWas Canada pressured to buy the F-35 fighter jet? Will the jet ever deliver on its promise of being the top gun in the sky? Did the government cover up the true costs to win an election? With secret documents and exclusive interviews with Air Force insiders, Gillian Findlay pieces together the troubling story of the F-35. From Lockheed Martin's first prototype and bungled development process to Canada's decision to buy the fighter jet without an open competition, &quot;Runaway Fighter&quot; raises serious questions about a procurement system seemingly run amok and a jetfighter critics say will never live up to its spin.\n\n\nShow description:\nCanadian television newsmagazine, airing on CBC. Its primary focus is on investigative journalism.\n\n\n\n--- File Information ---                                                        \nFile Name        : The.Fifth.Estate.S38E03.Runaway.Fighter.HDTV.x264-CLDD.mp4\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 715 Kbps\nLength            : 231 MiB for 45mn 6s 730ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 562 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 400 (1.800) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 149 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:345b60db5842306d1cc844d7f9c13b9b0e13c5e2","amp;dn":"The.Fifth.Estate.S38E03.Runaway.Fighter.HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"345b60db5842306d1cc844d7f9c13b9b0e13c5e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,91,96,219,88,66,48,109,28,200,68,215,249,193,59,155,14,19,197,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
