Written by Anonymous\n\nRyan Bingham's job is to fire people from theirs. The anguish, hostility, and despair of his &quot;clients&quot; has left him falsely compassionate, living out of a suitcase, and loving every second of it. When his boss hires arrogant young Natalie, she develops a method of video conferencing that will allow termination without ever leaving the office - essentially threatening the existence Ryan so cherishes. Determined to show the naive girl the error of her logic, Ryan takes her on one of his cross country firing expeditions, but as she starts to realize the disheartening realities of her profession, he begins to see the downfalls to his way of life.\n\n\nVideo\n\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 45mn\nBit rate : 940 Kbps\nWidth : 624 pixels\nHeight : 336 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 1.857\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nResolution : 8 bits\nColorimetry : 4:2:0\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.187\n\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo / MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 45mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 101 Kbps\nNominal bit rate : 112 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7893121d8f2916b3651c198c3cc8916d66813f1","amp;dn":"Up+In+the+Air+%282009%29+DvdRip+%5BXvid%5D+%7B1337x%7D-X-%5BExtraTorrent%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7893121d8f2916b3651c198c3cc8916d66813f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,137,49,33,216,242,145,107,54,81,193,152,195,204,137,22,214,104,19,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
