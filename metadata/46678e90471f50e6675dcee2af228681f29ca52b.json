If it really is true that bankersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ reputation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhas fallen below that of estate agents or even journalistsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, things must be pretty dire indeed in the City.\nIan Hislop: When Bankers Were Good (BBC Two) sidesteps the usual palaver over whether over-complex financial instruments, a lack of government regulation or perhaps capitalism itself are to blame for the current crisis, focussing instead on the personal attitudes to wealth and charitable giving of the (mostly) men running the show.\nHislop clearly believes that current bankers had a lot to learn from their Victorian predecessors. The lives of philanthropic Victorians from Samuel Gurney, founder of a formidable family-run Quaker banking dynasty, to Angela Burdett-Coutts, for whom no cause was too small to be deserving (British Goat Society included), were enthusiastically chronicled in the programme.\nIn a further piece of fortuitous timing Hislop spoke with Giles Fraser, formerly St PaulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Canon Chancellor until becoming an unlikely victim of the aggrieved campers on his cathedralÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s holy doorstep. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe city has to have a much greater sense of responsibility for the world around itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ declares Fraser, probably not imagining the health and safety concerns now being employed by the City of London to evict the protestors.\nHislop made for a thoughtful, amiable host throughout, showing none of the brittleness for which his appearances on Have I Got News for You or his editorship of Private Eye are known. He clearly enjoyed himself recounting anecdotes like that of Lord Nathaniel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNattyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ RothschildÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s birthday, when the banking giantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s act of generosity in giving a shilling to every child in the nearby town of Tring was rather exploited as townsfolk shipped in young cousins and friends from across the country.\n\nIt is certainly heartening, if unlikely, to imagine that some of the CityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pinstripe-clad finest might have been watching and taking note of precedents set by the Frys and Peabodys of centuries past. But as Hislop admits, it is not simply societyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s morality which has changed since the Golden Age of Philanthropy.\nEarly bankers were relatively free of the taxation which funded the welfare state from the twentieth century onward, shifting the noblesse oblige from society to government, and were frequently guided by powerful religious mores.\nStill, a bit of embarrassed soul-searching within the Square Mile probably wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t go amiss.\n\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (720x400)\nVCodec: XviD 2pass from AVC in TS\nAudio: AC3 2ch 192Kbps in TS\n\nHD downsized/resized\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46678e90471f50e6675dcee2af228681f29ca52b","amp;dn":"BBC+Ian+Hislop++When+Bankers+Were+Good+XviD+AC3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46678e90471f50e6675dcee2af228681f29ca52b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,103,142,144,71,31,80,230,103,93,206,226,175,34,134,129,242,156,165,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
