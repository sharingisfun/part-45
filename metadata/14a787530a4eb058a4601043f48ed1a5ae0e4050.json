Seth whisks Charlie to EllauriaÃ¢â‚¬â€a magical world filled with the creatures of myths and legendsÃ¢â‚¬â€and tells her of the Fellowship, the group charged with protecting mystical beings from human discovery. (All except Bigfoot: that attention whore is a total lost cause.) But when Charlie learns that she's under the Fellowship's protection herself, well, &quot;stressed&quot; is an understatement.\n\nEllauria should be the safest place for Charlie while the Fellowship works to find her family, but things in the mystical realm arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t what they seem.\n\nMagic is failing, creatures are dying, and the Fellowship insists Charlie holds the key to saving everyone. With her family still missing and the danger in Ellauria growing, Charlie doesn't know who she can trust. She's dealing with a power she never asked for, falling for a guy she can't have, and being forced to choose between her destiny and her heart. And if she chooses wrong, she could destroy magic forever.\n\nCharlie may be in over her head","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14a787530a4eb058a4601043f48ed1a5ae0e4050","amp;dn":"Between+by+Megan+Whitmer+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14a787530a4eb058a4601043f48ed1a5ae0e4050","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,167,135,83,10,78,176,88,164,96,16,67,244,142,209,165,174,14,64,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
