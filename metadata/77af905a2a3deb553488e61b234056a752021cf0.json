After this upload I will take a break for a couple of weeks; as Breezin' said, i've been uploading like hell for last six month...and uploaded a quarter of my collection...Welcome to all who gived thanks in comments to my uploads and to all seeders! It is easy to dl, but without seeders...\n\nOne of the most rewarding events for jazz musicians is the jam session.\nThe gathering together of star musicians for such a session can make it a rewarding and entertaining experience for an audience too. One man made them into spectacular occasions; Norman Granz. Two other names are notable for bringing the skills of some of the greatest musicians of the 20th century to the attention of the public; talent scout John Hammond and producer George Avakian. Without the efforts of these three farsighted individuals, much of the finest music of the last century would have gone unrecorded.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
