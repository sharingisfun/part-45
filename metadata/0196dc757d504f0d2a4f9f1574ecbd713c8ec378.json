The LA Area Crowd was actually not too badly behaved this \r\nevening, one group of late-arrivers mid-way thru the 3rd song are briefly audible. \r\nThe recording came out well. David and his band performed an entertaining show \r\nwith varied material from early Pink Floyd thru his new solo material. We\r\nenjoyed this performance.
