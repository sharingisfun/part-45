The Outer Limits is an original 1 hour paranormal show with actors making complex decisions in unusual circumstances. It explores how far people will go and how much terror is actually possible in life. The episodes start will a scary narrator voice and end with his voice. Many times, the ending is not a happy one, but a more realistic twist of good and evil. It&amp;#039;s hard to just describe the show since they&amp;#039;re have been so many variants. Cloning, murder, alternate dimension, space travel, family values, time travel, human perfection. You name it, there&amp;#039;s been a chilling tale of it on The Outer Limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ef0e423e1d3b5e385ba16583fafd7236398f7b2","amp;dn":"The+Outer+Limits+%281995%29++DVD+1%2F6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ef0e423e1d3b5e385ba16583fafd7236398f7b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,240,228,35,225,211,181,227,133,186,22,88,63,175,215,35,99,152,247,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
