Webster (Wiley, 2006).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9780471263586\r\n\r\nThe articles in The Encyclopedia of Medical Devices and Instrumentation focus on what is currently useful or is likely to be useful in future medicine. They answer the question, &quot;What are the branches of medicine and how does technology assist each of them?&quot; Articles focus on the practice of medicine that is assisted by devices, rather than including, for example, the use of drugs to treat disease. The title is the only resource on the market dealing with the subject in encyclopedic detail.\r\n* Accessible to practitioners with a broad range of backgrounds from students to researchers and physicians\r\n* Articles cover the latest developments such as nanotechnology, fiber optics, and signal processing\r\n\r\nReview\r\n&quot;â€¦this set would provide scientific researchers with a useful initial understanding of technologiesâ€¦&quot; (American Reference Books Annual, March 2007)\r\n\r\n&quot;...highly desirable for biomedical engineering programs and health-care providers in need of an in-depth discussion of the design and function of medical devices...highly recommended.&quot; (CHOICE, September 2006)\r\n\r\n&quot;This is a monumental work...all who have been involved are to be credited for a significant and worthy contribution to our accessible body of knowledge!&quot; (IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, July/August 2006)\r\n\r\nFrom the Publisher\r\nThis objective, referenced collection of over 300 articles will cover every aspect of medical devices and instrumentation in four volumes, totalling about 3,000 pages. The Encyclopedia will define the discipline by bringing together the core of knowledge from all the fields encompassed by the application of engineering, physics, and computers to problems in medicine. Some of the many areas covered will include: anaesthesiology; burns; cardiology; clinical chemistry and engineering; critical care medicine; dermatology; dentistry; endocrinology; genetics; gynecology; microbiology; oncology; pharmacology; psychiatry; radiology; surgery; and urology.
