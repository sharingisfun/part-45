Once rediscovered by the folks at Prestige/Bluesville (like so many blues artists), he was placed in the studio with an understandably nervous young harp player named Larry Johnson and legendary bassist Willie Dixon. What resulted was a down-home jam session in which Big Joe dragged the others to wherever his personal muse led. Highly personalized versions of ancient ballads are the norm here, with Big Joe's fluid fingerpicking weaving its way around Dixon's deep, syncopated groove. It's incredible how tight the trio is and how original each song sounds considering the improvised nature of the sessions. But then, the great ones always make it sound easy. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35a7abf1f3a776ee30e36db45aed815158f8ddc8","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Big+Joe+Williams+-+Walking+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35a7abf1f3a776ee30e36db45aed815158f8ddc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,167,171,241,243,167,118,238,48,227,109,180,90,237,129,81,88,248,221,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
