Baert, Harry K. Genant, George Y. El-Khoury, &quot;Imaging in Percutaneous Musculoskeletal Interventions&quot; \n Publisher: Springer | ISBN: 3540220976 | edition 2008 | PDF | 414 pages | 13.7 mb\n\n This is one of the first books to deal specifically with imaging in percutaneous musculoskeletal interventions. In the first chapter, the basic procedures and different guidance techniques are presented and discussed. Ensuing chapters describe in exhaustive detail the abilities and uses of imaging in guiding procedures ranging from biopsy and joint injection to management of pain and tumors. The third part of the book documents the different indications for vascular interventions in musculoskeletal lesions. The final chapter focuses on ultrasound-guided interventions, as they are more common and tend to be fashionable. The book is well illustrated with carefully chosen and technically excellent images. Each of the 18 chapters is written by an expert of international repute, making this book the most current and complete treatment of the subject available. It should be of great interest to interventional radiologists and also musculoskeletal and general radiologists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d347522d81aea27c50a1532f0c0412e6fe11e7d","amp;dn":"Imaging+in+Percutaneous+Musculoskeletal+Interventions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d347522d81aea27c50a1532f0c0412e6fe11e7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,52,117,34,216,26,234,39,197,10,21,50,240,192,65,46,111,225,30,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
