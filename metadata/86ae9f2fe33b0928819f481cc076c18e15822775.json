Although the brothers DJed in the late 1980 and were remixing and composing as far back as the early 1990s, they were largely popularised by the British Radio 1 DJ Gilles Peterson in around 2001. The brothers are currently signed to Compost Records.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kyotojazzmassive.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kyotojazzmassive.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86ae9f2fe33b0928819f481cc076c18e15822775","amp;dn":"Essence+Of+Especial++Compiled+By+Kyoto+Jazz+Massive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86ae9f2fe33b0928819f481cc076c18e15822775","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,174,159,47,227,59,9,40,129,159,72,28,192,118,193,142,21,130,39,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
