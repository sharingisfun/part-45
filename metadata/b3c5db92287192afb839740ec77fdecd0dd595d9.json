Fischer-Cripps \nFormat: PDF\nHardcover: 238 pages\nPublisher: CRC Press; 2 edition (August 14, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN: 9781466517820\n\nUnderstand the Physics of the Solid State\nUpdated and expanded with new topics, The Materials Physics Companion, 2nd Edition puts the physics of the solid state within the reach of students by offering an easy-to-navigate pathway from basic knowledge through to advanced concepts. This edition illustrates how electrical and magnetic properties of matter arise from the basic principles of quantum mechanics in a way that is accessible to science and engineering students.\n\nA Convenient, Student-Friendly Format Rich with Diagrams and Clear Explanations\nThe book uses the unique signature style of the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other companion books, providing detailed graphics, simple and clear explanations of difficult concepts, and annotated mathematical treatments. It covers quantum mechanics, x-ray analysis, solid-state physics, the mechanical and thermal properties of solids, the electrical and magnetic properties of solids, and superconductivity, assuming no prior knowledge of these advanced areas. Suitable for undergraduate students in science and engineering, the book is also a handy refresher for professional scientists and educators","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3c5db92287192afb839740ec77fdecd0dd595d9","amp;dn":"The+Materials+Physics+Companion%2C+2nd+Edition+%5B2014%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3c5db92287192afb839740ec77fdecd0dd595d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,197,219,146,40,113,146,175,184,57,116,14,199,127,222,205,13,213,149,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
