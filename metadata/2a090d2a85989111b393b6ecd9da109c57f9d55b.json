It consists of singer Jim Leedy (a.k.a. &quot;Elvis Hitler&quot;), guitarist John Defever, bassist Warren Defever, and drummer Damian Lang. Their irreverent mix of rockabilly and lowbrow humor led to them having a cult following in their day, though they never had commercial success. The band managed to put out three CDs on Restless Records. They then disappeared from the public spotlight for the first time. Warren Defever would go on to front the dramatically-different sounding His Name Is Alive, and work as a record producer for underground bands.\nIn 1998, however, Elvis Hitler reunited as a four piece band, with Rich Strock filling in on bass, and played at various locations in Detroit and in Chicago. They then faded away again. They once more reunited in 2003 at The Magic Stick club in Detroit with Warren Defever returning to the bass. They played one more concert at that club on September 4th, 2004.\nTheir minor &quot;hit&quot; song &quot;Green Haze&quot; consisted of the lyrics from the successful TV-show Green Acres sung to the tune of Jimi Hendrix's &quot;Purple Haze.&quot;\nDue to the resistance of having a band with the name Hitler in the title, regardless of its intent, the band released one album under the name &quot;Splatter.&quot;\n\n\nDisgraceland (1988)\n&quot;Cool Daddy In A Cadillac&quot;\n&quot;Live Fast, Die Young&quot;\n&quot;Hot Rod To Hell&quot;\n&quot;Rocking Over Russia&quot;\n&quot;Berlin To Memphis&quot;\n&quot;Elvis' Ripoff Theme&quot;\n&quot;Battle Cry Of 1000 Men&quot;\n&quot;Green Haze (Parts I &amp; II)&quot;\n&quot;I Love Your Guts&quot;\n&quot;Ten Wheels For Jesus&quot;\n&quot;Black Babies Dancing On Fire&quot;\n&quot;Crush Your Skull&quot;\n&quot;Disgraceland&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a090d2a85989111b393b6ecd9da109c57f9d55b","amp;dn":"Elvis+Hitler+-+Disgraceland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a090d2a85989111b393b6ecd9da109c57f9d55b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,9,13,42,133,152,145,17,179,147,182,236,217,218,16,156,87,249,213,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
