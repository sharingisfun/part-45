Barker's mindblowing booklet The Pillar of Destiny which is a very rare Christian identity book covering the history and migrations of Christians until they reached the shores of America and founded a new nation there. Also discusses the Coronation stone, Israel in the isles, the Harp of Ireland and the Stone of destiny. The Pillar of Destiny tells the fascinating story of people who literally searched the whole world for a place where they could worship their god without anyone prosecuting them. 70 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cca8424003f9f70d832ea46073e7ea9a9acb3dab","amp;dn":"Barker-Pillar+of+Destiny%28historic+migrations+of+Christians+to+Am","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cca8424003f9f70d832ea46073e7ea9a9acb3dab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,168,66,64,3,249,247,13,131,46,164,96,115,231,234,154,154,203,61,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
