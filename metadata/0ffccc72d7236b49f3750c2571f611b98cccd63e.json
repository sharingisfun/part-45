These changes make the Firefly family appear more like the monsters they should have been, while bringing out the revenge factor of Sheriff John. The film now also has the appeal of a 1970's road movie.\n\nIntention:\n\nTo remove as much of Rob Zombie's over the top scenes as possible (as well as many scenes of ridiculous stupidity), and to correct his complete loss of plot focus. These changes included making the Firefly family appear more of the monsters they should have been, while bringing out the revenge factor of Sheriff John.\n\nI also wanted to give the film a 1970's road movie appeal. You are now left with a 1970's style road movie revenge film focusing on Sheriff Wydell's desire to bring the hammer of justice down on the Firefly family.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nI actually liked the Devil's Rejects. I also did not mind (well) most of his over the top madness (as Zombie usually does). However like some of his other films, a much more streamlined and darker vision is lying underneath the mayhem. In this case I wanted to bring that back and in doing so found a few more benefits that contributed to this edit overall.\n\nFaneditor Name: Tranzor\nOriginal Movie Title: The Devil's Rejects\nGenre: Horror\nFanedit Type: FanFix\nOriginal Release Date: 2005\nOriginal Running Time: 109\nFanedit Release Date: August 2009\nFanedit Running Time (Min): 85\nTime Cut (Min): 24\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ffccc72d7236b49f3750c2571f611b98cccd63e","amp;dn":"Sheriff+John+Quincy+Wydell%3A+Devil+Hunter+%28B%26amp%3BW%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ffccc72d7236b49f3750c2571f611b98cccd63e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,252,204,114,215,35,107,73,243,117,12,37,113,246,17,185,140,204,214,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
