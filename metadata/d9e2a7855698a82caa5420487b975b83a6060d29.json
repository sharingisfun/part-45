After a capable follow-up in ``Face Of Despair``, internal strife led to an initial breakup in 1991. Bassist Andy Eftichiou recruited an all-new lineup that eventually produced ``Rebellious Youth``. This drew the ire of the other original members who eventually initiated legal action, and this version of the band also folded. Finally, four of the five original members came back together in 1996, and one member change later released a mini-LP of reworked and re-recorded songs along with a few new tracks. But the personal differences amongst the members arose once again, and by late 1998 the band was once again done. By 2002 the band was back in business.\n\nDiscography\n\n\nMayhemic Destruction \tFull-length, 1987\t\t[3 reviews, average 81%]\nFace of Despair \tEP, 1988\t\nFace Of Despair \tSingle, 1989\t\nVoyage of the disturbed \tSingle, 1989\t\nFace of Despair \tFull-length, 1989\t\t[2 reviews, average 75%]\nFace of Mayhem - Live \tVideo/VHS, 1990\t\nI am Immortal \tSingle, 1990\t\n1990 demo \tDemo, 1990\t\nEvery Dog Has Its Day \tSingle, 1991\t\nEvery Dog Has Its Day a.k.a.
