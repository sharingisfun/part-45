The band was officially formed in 1986, although some date the band to bedroom tape experiments from 1982.[1][2] The band&amp;#039;s output is usually referred to as noise rock or sometimes Japanoise, though their more recent records have been largely based around repetitive minimalism, ambient music, and tribal drumming.\n\nThe band has a vast and sometimes confusing discography. Many band members have rotated through the group over the years, often using a number of various stage names. Singer Yamantaka Eye is the closest the band has to a frontman; his style includes a range of baffling screams, babbling, electronic effects, and very heavy post-production. Drummer/singer/trumpeter Yoshimi P-We has also featured on most Boredoms recordings.&quot;\n\n-from wiki","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9a894c513745ad270eec45ca27124c5cb17d983","amp;dn":"Boredoms+-+Rebore+1+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9a894c513745ad270eec45ca27124c5cb17d983","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,168,148,197,19,116,90,210,112,238,196,92,162,113,36,197,203,23,217,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
