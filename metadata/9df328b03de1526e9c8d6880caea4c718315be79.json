Once a member of pioneering groups Niekku and Aldargaz, from the Sibelius Academy Folk Music Department, where she now teaches, her roots are in folk and classical music but her sights and abilities go far beyond existing styles. Technically brilliant as a player, and adept at improvisation, she is also a very powerful, intuitive and sensitive composer, with pieces that stylistically touch in numerous areas but feature her own personality as the driving force. Melody is the meaning and with Maria, listeners are sure to feel her message deeply.\n\nMaria has released many albums with many ensembles including the international accordion collective Accordion Tribe. Maria has toured and performed throughout Europe, USA, Canada and Japan. Her newest album, Vilda Rosor Wild Roses, a collection of Finnish-Swedish songs, was released in Finland in October 2010. Appearing on the album are guest musicians Olli Varis,  Eero GrundstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m, Pekka Lehti, Arto JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rvelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤, Janne Wiksten and more.\nMaria Kalaniemi's Vilda Rosor album (Aito Records) entered the December 2010 listing of the World Music Charts Europe Top 10 in the Number 2 position. Vilda Rosor was nominated, among a total of five albums, as Best Folk Music album in the annual Emma  awards of 2010. \n\n\n 1. I Fjol\n 2. VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rens VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤na GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶nska GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥r\n 3.
