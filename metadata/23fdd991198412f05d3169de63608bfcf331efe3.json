When he    :\n : expertly nails his target - a suspected enemy of the country - he sees     :\n : something on leaving the scene of crime which he suspects will have deadly :\n : consequences . . . Robie saves a young teenage runaway who has escaped from:\n : a private facility and seems to be in great danger. The location of her    :\n : parents is unknown and after she's returned to the police, he decides to   :\n : keep tabs on her because there's something about her which makes him       :\n : suspicious. As Robie learns more of the girl's past, it becomes evident to :\n : him that a cover-up, which may well have links to the disappearance of the :\n : girl's parents, looks likely to stretch to the very highest levels of      :\n : power. The police, while investigating the hit, start to take an interest  :\n : in Robie and he's particularly attracting the attention of a tenacious     :\n : female investigator who believes that the two cases may be connected.      :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23fdd991198412f05d3169de63608bfcf331efe3","amp;dn":"David+Baldacci+The+Innocent+2012+Retail+EPUB+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23fdd991198412f05d3169de63608bfcf331efe3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,253,217,145,25,132,18,240,93,49,105,222,99,96,139,252,243,49,239,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
