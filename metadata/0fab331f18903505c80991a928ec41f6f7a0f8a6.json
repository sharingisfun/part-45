Nevertheless, the Dead were famed for the anything-can-happen ethos of their live shows, and it just so happened that on Independence Day of '89 they were undeniably on fire. Jerry Garcia is bursting with the energy of a man half his age, as he belts out his vocals authoritatively and delivers stinging guitar bursts that are at once concise and expository. Bob Weir, notorious for showing more reckless gusto than precision, is as spot-on as he is emotive. Brent Mydland's organ, often relegated to the shadows, frequently emerges to provide biting commentary on the proceedings. The ensemble as a whole displays a kind of group-mind, the achievement of which was always the ultimate goal for both the band and their undyingly loyal followers. Whether delivering their newer material (&quot;Touch of Grey&quot;), covering Dylan (&quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot;) and Buddy Holly (&quot;Not Fade Away&quot;), or revisiting their own classic tunes (&quot;Ship of Fools,&quot; &quot;Playing in the Band&quot;), \n\nRecording information: Rich Stadium, Orchard Park, NY (07/04/1989).\n\nPersonnel: Jerry Garcia (vocals, guitar); Brent Mydland (vocals, keyboards); Phil Lesh (vocals, electric bass); Bob Weir (vocals); Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann (drums).\n\n\nTruckin' Up To Buffalo Disc 1: \n1.Bertha  \n2.Greatest Story Ever Told  \n3.Cold Rain and Snow   \n4.Walkin' Blues\n5.Row Jimmy   \n6.When I Paint My Masterpiece   \n7.Stagger Lee   \n8.Looks Like Rain  \n9.Deal   \n10.Touch of Grey  \n11.Man Smart, Woman Smarter \n\nTruckin' Up To Buffalo: Disc 2: \n1.Ship of Fools  \n2.Playing in the Band  \n3.Terrapin Station  \n4.Drums \n5.Space \n6.I Will Take You Home  \n7.All Along the Watchtower   \n8.Morning Dew  \n9.Not Fade Away   \n10.U.S. Blues  \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fab331f18903505c80991a928ec41f6f7a0f8a6","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead++Truckin%5C%27++Buffalo%282CD%29%28rock%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fab331f18903505c80991a928ec41f6f7a0f8a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,171,51,31,24,144,53,5,200,9,145,169,40,236,65,246,247,160,248,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
