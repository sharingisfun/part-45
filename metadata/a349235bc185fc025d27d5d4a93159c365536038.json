The CD finds Ms. Woodward in the studio with a number of top music producers including the esteemed Tony Visconti. Funny enough, I was just marveling at his fab productions with David Bowie back in early Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ68 and lo and behold the famous Tony Visconti string sound is all over the first half of Lucy WoodwardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CD. Glad to see Tony hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lost his knack for helping develop and cultivate great, rising pop talent. According to Ms. Woodward, Ã¢â‚¬ËœI wanted to make a modern-day torch record, but I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to do a record of all standards, because I had stuff I wanted to say.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Funny enough, Lucy was born in London and emigrated to New York City at age five so sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a real New York vibe in her blood. Her originals click in a kind of timeless pop eraÃ¢â‚¬â€a modern day sound based around her appreciation of jazz standards and jazz singers from the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ40s to the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s. A set closing cover of Hoagy CarmichaelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“StardustÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a good barometer of the respect Ms. Woodward brings to the 21st century jazz world. The supporting musiciansÃ¢â‚¬â€including jazz guitar ace Frank VignolaÃ¢â‚¬â€and the orchestrations by Visconti are typically brilliant while the other producers work their charms. On Hooked! Ms. Woodward brings out her deeply rooted jazz and soul music influences with a sound that elegantly dovetails in this classically-etched yet thoroughly modern and swinging pop-jazz album. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a349235bc185fc025d27d5d4a93159c365536038","amp;dn":"Lucy+Woodward...Hooked%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a349235bc185fc025d27d5d4a93159c365536038","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,73,35,91,193,133,252,2,93,39,213,212,169,49,89,195,101,83,96,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
