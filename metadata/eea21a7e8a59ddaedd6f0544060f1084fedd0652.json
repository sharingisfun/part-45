This contains the razor1911, which bypasses steam by downloading the game through its own program. \n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nOnce downloaded, put the file onto your desktop, and open it. Run the razor install application (370kb) and download the game to the predestined folder it creates. When the download is finished, find the folder it installed the game to (Computer/Local Disk/Program Files/The Elder Scrolls V). Open [The Elder Scrolls V], go back to SKRM folder, open razor1911 folder, highlight all 4 files and copy, go back to The Elder Scrolls V file, and paste+replace the files in the folder. Then the copy your new icon named SkyrimLauncher to your desktop. Double-Click and have a great time! If you encounter an installation error, please follow the directions again. This is a step by step instruction manual for you!\n\nThanks for downloading. Please seed, this is the only Skyrim torrent that contains the actual files directly for the game. I would appreciate very much if you all could get this torrent up and running. If you don't normally seed, please do at least for a day. This torrent needs seeders to begin it's journey. I will personally seed until 12/28/2011, until a week from now. I cannot stress it enough, please seed!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eea21a7e8a59ddaedd6f0544060f1084fedd0652","amp;dn":"The+Elder+Scrolls+V+-+SKYRIM+-+Razor1911","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eea21a7e8a59ddaedd6f0544060f1084fedd0652","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,162,26,126,138,89,221,174,221,111,5,68,6,15,16,132,254,221,6,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
