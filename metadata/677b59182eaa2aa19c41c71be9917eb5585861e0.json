The Hunt dropped some artists from its lineup, added others, and moved to a harder rock sound. Members of the new formation, at least at one point of its existence or another, were guitarists Paul Dickinson and Paul Cockburn, drummer and percussionist Paul Kersey, keyboardist Jacques Harrison, keyboardist and bassist Gerry Mosby, bassist Carl Calvert, and guitarist and bassist Brian Gagnon. Most of the guys also provided vocals. The Hunt recorded a number of singles and a few albums before calling it quits in 1984.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. I Was Only Dreaming (4:26)\n02.
