But this is no four-track analog recording full of bounce-downs - it makes full use of all that the 21st century digital realm allows, with laptops, loops, and other digital doodads blended into the mix (Black is even credited in the album liner notes with playing instruments called &quot;atmosphere&quot; and &quot;noise,&quot; along with the pianos, guitars, and harmonicas he also played). Recorded largely in his home studio in Birmingham, Alabama (some additional recording and the final mixing was done at Tom Schick's Magic Shop in New York City), Black did use some additional musicians in the later stages of the project (including drummer Josh Cannon, who plays with Black as a duo called Fort Atlantic for live shows), and the resulting album is a wonderful bit of anthemic and melodic dream pop, sounding a bit like Jackson Browne set loose in a Pro Tools playground. But Fort Atlantic is no 21st century Frankenstein project. It sounds like classic rock, free of gimmicks even as it is actually laced with them, and as a lesson in how what's new can be used to make something that seems old and timeless, Fort Atlantic has to get an A plus.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b769974b632a376844ca25863922a6b299bdec11","amp;dn":"Fort+Atlantic+%282012%29+%5BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b769974b632a376844ca25863922a6b299bdec11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,105,151,75,99,42,55,104,68,202,37,134,57,34,166,178,153,189,236,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
