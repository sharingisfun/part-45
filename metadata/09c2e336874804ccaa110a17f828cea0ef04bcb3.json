Starting with an acoustic guitar intro, the song grinds into fast-paced hard rock that was the signature sound of the band in their early years. &quot;Crazy on You&quot; attracted attention both for the relatively unusual combination of an acoustic guitar paired with an electric guitar, and the fact that the acoustic guitarist was a female - a rarity in rock music.\n\nThe song&amp;#039;s lyrics tell of a woman&amp;#039;s desire to forget all the problems of the world during one night of lust and passion. According to Ann Wilson, the lyrics were written under the influence of mushrooms.\n\nIssued by Canada&amp;#039;s Mushroom Records, the song became Heart&amp;#039;s first U.S. chart entry, peaking at number thirty-five on the Billboard Hot 100. Two years later, the single was re-released by Mushroom ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ this time reaching number sixty-two in the U.S. In the Netherlands it reached number two on the singles chart in March 1977. The single&amp;#039;s B-side, &quot;Dreamboat Annie&quot;, was later released on its own as an A-side.\n\nDespite its modest chart placing in 1976, &quot;Crazy on You&quot; remains as one of Heart&amp;#039;s signature tunes and is still a staple on U.S. classic rock radio stations.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09c2e336874804ccaa110a17f828cea0ef04bcb3","amp;dn":"Heart+-+Crazy+On+You+%28Live-2007+Dreamboat+Annie+Concert%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09c2e336874804ccaa110a17f828cea0ef04bcb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,194,227,54,135,72,4,204,170,17,10,23,248,40,206,160,239,4,188,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
