This year, Willy Moon's does the same Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and offers a microcosm of their differing approaches. White's version was jumping but respectful; Moon's puts a scratchy guitar line atop juddering drum-machine beats, while he quavers and hollers the vocal line in 50s fashion. In fact, that's more or less what he does across the album. Sometimes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as on the single I Wanna Be Your Man Ã¢â‚¬â€œ there's a little bit more going on, something other than his voice to carry some melody, and there's a cleverness to the onomatopoeic percussion of Working for the Company, which sounds like a production line. However, older listeners will be transported straight to the 80s by this rockabilly/technology fusion Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not just because the beats are so purposely clumsy, but because Here's Willy Moon sounds far less like a fusion of Elvis and urban than it does Sigue Sigue Sputnik and Westworld, who had exactly the same idea nearly 30 years ago.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6bb4a026ea92d1065151e8f7cdbd75a66c44b09","amp;dn":"Willy+Moon+-+Here%27s+Willy+Moon+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6bb4a026ea92d1065151e8f7cdbd75a66c44b09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,187,74,2,110,169,45,16,101,21,30,143,124,219,215,90,102,196,75,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
