Neil Gaiman&amp;#039;s Fragile Things as read by the author. \n\nIt&amp;#039;s a good read and an even better listen as Gaiman&amp;#039;s English charm shines through like you wouldn&amp;#039;t believe. The Audio files are named 1, 2, etc, however the data has been entered into Windows Media Player, so you should be able to use it without any difficulty finding what your looking for. \n\nCheers,\n\n\n\nTietsu","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfc6f43a504aef24ad027792af4b57a3f0261dab","amp;dn":"Neil+Gaiman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfc6f43a504aef24ad027792af4b57a3f0261dab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,198,244,58,80,74,239,36,173,2,119,146,175,75,87,163,240,38,29,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
