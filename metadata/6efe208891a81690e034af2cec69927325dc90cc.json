What could go wrong? She seems friendly and intelligent, and is definitely easy on the eye. He seems kind, funny and is undeniably cute. Not only is this a sensible financial move, it could end up being a great way of making a new friend for life. Or it could turn out to be the worst move they ever made?\n\nHouse On Fire is a comedy series about two strangers who buy a house together, and then discover that they hate each other. Stuck together, but too financially intertwined to extricate themselves, Matt and Vicky must put up with each other's annoying habits before they lose their minds. Constantly at loggerheads, occasionally at war, each pulls out all the stops to try make the other leave.\n\nSecretly, they might love each other - but if they do, they've got a funny way of showing it.\n\n\n\n\nwww.comedy.co.uk Review: \n\nQuote:We were quite entertained by this sitcom, particularly Vicky - Emma Pierson has managed to make the character both scary (she's a bit of a psychopathic control freak) and, at the same time, sexy &amp; loveable too.\n\nThe parents, who were sadly mainly peripheral characters, were also fun - Matt's parents are clearly pleased to see the back of him (his mum Julie even managed to turn down his house party invite before they've been invited), whilst Vicky's father was obviously harbouring a few dark secrets.\n\n\nCast:\nEmma Pierson\nJody Latham\nRupert Vansittart\nJanine Duvitski\nPhilip Jackson\nFergus Craig\nColin Hoult\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/house_on_fire/episodes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/house_on_fire/episodes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHouse On Fire - S01 - E01 - Moving In\nHouse On Fire - S01 - E02 - Party\nHouse On Fire - S01 - E03 - Neighbourhood Watch\nHouse On Fire - S01 - E04 - Emergency\nHouse On Fire - S01 - E05 - Filth\nHouse On Fire - S01 - E06 - Hot Water\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 31s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6efe208891a81690e034af2cec69927325dc90cc","amp;dn":"House+On+Fire+-+Series+01+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6efe208891a81690e034af2cec69927325dc90cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,254,32,136,145,168,22,144,224,52,175,44,236,105,146,115,37,220,144,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
