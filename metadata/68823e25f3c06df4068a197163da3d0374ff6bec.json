The planet bears the scars of this encounter as much of the world is barren and the ocean has turned to sand. For different reasons, four characters set out to become &quot;drifters&quot; and make their own path over the plains. Virginia Maxwell chose this trip on a steam train because she was bored by the monotonous life in a sleepy village and wanted to explore the world. Treasure-hunter Jet Enduro thinks the train will bring him to a place where a flower with magic powers can be found. Gallows Caradine is a shaman of his tribe and is the guardian of a sacred artifact. Clive Winslet is a cynical archaeologist and part-time bounty hunter. A fateful encounter aboard a train will bring these four together and mix them up in the doings of a mysterious organization of scientists. This Council of Seven once was formed to renew the life force of Filgara, but now seems to be harnessing it for their own means.\n\nThis third installment of the Wild Arms series continues the tradition of two previous games, adding a stronger emphasis on the (fantasy) Wild West atmosphere. Characters have the ability to attack using ARMS (projectile weapons), use special abilities, use items or cast Arcana (magic). From the beginning of the game, each of the four characters has an introductory chapter before becoming a party and traveling together. The battles are random, with a FP gauge which fills while attacking and defending, and usage of Arms and magic which require FP, similar to the second game of the series. Later on, special vehicles feature their own type of battle system. Other similarities to previous Wild arms games include the search system (towns and dungeons are not indicated on the map until you discover them), the ability to cancel a random battle and special abilities used outside of battles to solve puzzles. An interesting innovation is a dialogue based on key words, similar to a system commonly used in adventure games, which allows a more flexible use of dialogue options.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Cell shading technology delivers vibrant and energetic visuals.\n\n* Artistic anime sequences tie into gameplay visuals and enhance an epic storyline.\n\n* Prologues for each character deliver depth and development.\n\n* &quot;Expressive-communication&quot; allows a player to read character moods and emotions.\n\n* Interactive field environments require the solving of intricate puzzles found \n  around every corner.\n\n* Utilize the special abilities of each character to explore mysterious dungeons, \n  find hidden items and unlock secret areas.\n\n* Turn-based encounters take on a whole new visual appeal with real-time character\n  movements.\n\n* Gunslingers use an array of weapons including six-shooters, a shotgun, a \n  revolver and a high powered rifle.\n\n* Customize weapon strength, accuracy, bullet capacity, critical hit ratio and\n  overall weight.\n\n* Summon mystical Guardians to unleash overwhelming attacks.\n\n* Engage in shootouts whether on foot, horseback or riding on a mechanized vehicle.\n\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't working.\n\n\nIf using DVD+R then booktype to DVD-ROM \n(If your mod-chip, or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R).\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68823e25f3c06df4068a197163da3d0374ff6bec","amp;dn":"Wild+Arms+3+%5BNtsc%5D%2C+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68823e25f3c06df4068a197163da3d0374ff6bec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,130,62,37,243,192,109,244,6,138,25,113,99,218,61,3,116,255,107,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
