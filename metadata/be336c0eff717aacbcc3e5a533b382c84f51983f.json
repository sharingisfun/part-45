This is WolfeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ultimate master class, in which he shares the most important insights and techniques learned in four decades of award-winning photography. Along with co-author Rob Sheppard, Wolfe challenges us to stop focusing on subjects we feel we should photograph and instead, to Ã¢â‚¬Å“see like a camera sees,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ seek out a personal point of view, and construct stunning, meaningful images. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn how to:\n\nÃ‚Â·      Reexamine prejudices that define (and limit) what you photograph\nÃ‚Â·      See beyond the subject to let light and shadow lead you to the right image\nÃ‚Â·      Find inspiration, including the story behind Wolfe's own photographic journey.\nÃ‚Â·      Use formal art principles to build more compelling images.\nÃ‚Â·      Choose the right camera and lens for the image you see in your mind's eye.\nÃ‚Â·      Recognize the 10 deadly sins of compositionÃ¢â‚¬â€and how to avoid them.\nÃ‚Â·      Ã¢â‚¬Â¦and even get a behind-the-lens look at WolfeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s equipment and workflow.\n \nNumber of pages: 256\n \nISBN13: 9780770433161\n \nISBN10: 0770433162\n \nFormat: EPUB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be336c0eff717aacbcc3e5a533b382c84f51983f","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+the+Photograph+by+Art+Wolfe+and+Rob+Sheppard+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be336c0eff717aacbcc3e5a533b382c84f51983f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,51,108,14,255,113,122,172,188,195,229,165,51,179,130,200,79,81,152,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
