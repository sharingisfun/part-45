Critically, it was hailed as one of the best games of 1997, and sold accordingly.\n\nThe game tells the story of its protagonist, Kurt Hectic and his attempts to rescue Earth from an alien invasion of gigantic strip mining city-vehicles named Mine-crawlers, which are not only removing all of earths natural resources but are also flattening any people and cities that get in their way. The game combined fast action with fully 3D rendered, state of the art (for the time) graphics and a warped sense of humor. It featured a never before seen sniper mode that allowed the player to zoom in on an enemy and target them with astonishing accuracy.\n\n\nFacts:\n\n- One of the greatest and most memorable action games of all time \n- Fun and addictive gameplay, filled with humor - a trademark of games by Shiny Entertainment \n\n\nExtras: The Manual and a preconfigured version of DOSBox for Mac OS X\n\n\nNote: This is the full game, all patches are installed and NoCD-Fixed\n\n\nInstall: Unzip and Play\n\n\nCheers,\n\nADHDerby","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60d4563e3d247eaa43e45c5cfec95bbcf31565d7","amp;dn":"MDK+%5BMac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60d4563e3d247eaa43e45c5cfec95bbcf31565d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,212,86,62,61,36,126,170,67,228,92,92,254,201,91,188,243,21,101,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
