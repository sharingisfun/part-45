But when another tragedy strikes, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forced to run and also deemed a fugitive. Dishonored, he has no choice but to accept work as a lowly gravedigger, a position that allows him to sharpen his corpse-reading skills. Soon, he can deduce whether a person killed himself Ã¢â‚¬â€ or was murdered.\nHis prowess earns him notoriety, and CÃƒÂ­ receives orders to unearth the perpetrator of a horrific series of mutilations and deaths at the Imperial Court. CÃƒÂ­Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s gruesome investigation quickly grows complicated thanks to old loyalties and the presence of an alluring, enigmatic woman.
