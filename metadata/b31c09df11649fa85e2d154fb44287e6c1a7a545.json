Since our musical tastes overlap slightly, I was\nquite familiar with some artists (Postal Service, Strokes, Ours, Sparta)\nand not so much with others (Morrissey (her favorite), Jets To Brazil, \nBright Eyes)\n\nThis is the first non-live mix I've created from scratch and I was\nquite pleased with the results.\n\nI first made this mix in a bit of a rush to give it to her on Christmas\nEve (version 1), then added some more songs later (version 2), then\ntweaked it some more (version 3) and finally decided I needed to stop\ntweaking it indefinately and just release it.\n\n\nDJ Shadow - Building Steam with a Grain Of Salt\nMorrissey - The More You Ignore Me, The Closer I Get\nThe Postal Service - Such Great Heights\nRadiohead - Backdrifts\nPortishead - Sour Times\nThe Smiths - How Soon Is Now\nLen - Steal My Sunshine\nThe White Stripes - My Doorbell\nThe Strokes - Is This It\nTarkan - Kuzu Kuzu\nDeath Cab For Cutie - Photobooth\nBlink 182 - I Miss You\nJets To Brazil - Starry Configurations\nAnything Box - Carmen\nBush - Glycerine\nMorrissey - Sunny\nThe Strokes - What Ever Happened\nOurs - Bleed\nSparta - Cataract\nREM - Orange Crush\nInterpol - Length Of Love\nDeath Cab For Cutie - Transatlanticism\nBright Eyes - A Perfect Sonnet\nOurs - If Flowers Turn\nThe White Stripes - Hardest Button To Button\nRadiohead - Lucky\nSparta - Echodyne Harmonic\nJets To Brazil - Orange Rhyming Dictionary\nPixies - Debaser\nMoby - Next Is The E\nWeezer - No One Else\nRadiohead - Idioteque\nStuart Davis - What\nUnderworld - Born Slippy\nCursive - Bad Sects\nRun Lola Run Soundtrack - Believe\nMorrissey - Suedehead\nThe Strokes - Trying Your Luck\nMorrissey - We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful\nThe Strokes - 12.51\nSparta - Air\nShe Wants Revenge - Tear You Apart\nThe Postal Service - The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\nStuart Davis - Easter\n\nGet more grooves from\nLeroy Skibone at\nwww.leroyskibone.com\nwww.infinitytunes.co.uk\n - mixing live every Sunday from 2-4pm (Chicago time), 8-10pm (London time)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b31c09df11649fa85e2d154fb44287e6c1a7a545","amp;dn":"Leroy+Skibone+Kitty+Mix+2011+%28V3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b31c09df11649fa85e2d154fb44287e6c1a7a545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,28,9,223,17,100,159,168,94,45,21,79,180,66,135,230,193,167,165,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
