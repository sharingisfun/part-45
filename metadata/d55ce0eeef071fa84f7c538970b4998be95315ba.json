Based on the Math Blaster CD-ROM games, produced by Nelvana, and aired on CBS for 13 episodes in 1999. Here's the premise:\n\n&quot;BlasterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Universe is an action adventure series that takes learning to the limits of the universe and back! Set in the year 2222, Blaster's Universe chronicles the adventures of Blaster, a bright, impetuous 12 year old boy obsessed with science and space, and his best friend G.C., a cool 12 year old girl who looks like an earthling but is really an alien. Based on the popular series of educational CDs, Blaster and G.C. must secretly work to save G.C.'s universe, using logic and creativity to outsmart the intergalactic outlaws.&quot;\n\nThese episodes still have the original English-language dialogue, but it's been lowered down and Russian voiceovers were heard over it (though if you listen closely, you can still hear the English dialogue). This is because they were all downloaded from a Russian video streaming website called now.ru before I got them. Hopefully someone (especially from Canada) would get all the episodes in just pure English someday.\n\nAnyway, despite that, I hope you enjoy this series, especially if you've played the games as a kid.\n\n\nList of episodes:\n\nEP1 - You're History\nEP2 - A Bridge Too Weak\nEP3 - Misplaced Weekend\nEP4 - A Spot of Trouble\nEP5 - Uncool Copycat\nEP6 - Mind Over Manners\nEP7 - Body Electric\nEP8 - Hero Today, Gone Tomorrow\nEP9 - Sound Advice\nEP10 - Math Schmath\nEP11 - Nowhere to Hide\nEP12 - Gym Nausium\nEP13 - Buggin' Out","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d55ce0eeef071fa84f7c538970b4998be95315ba","amp;dn":"Blaster%27s+Universe+%28Complete+13+episodes%3B+English+with+Russian+v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d55ce0eeef071fa84f7c538970b4998be95315ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,92,224,238,239,7,31,168,79,124,83,137,112,180,153,139,233,83,21,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
