Working with producer Tim OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Heir, who worked with All-American Rejects and Say Anything, the band follows the mold of those groups, fusing a pop-punk influence into its guitar-heavy sound, adding a sense of urgency to the music without sacrificing melody. The result is a kind of plaintive alt-rock thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s able to be uptempo without necessarily being upbeat, giving the album enough drive to grab listeners' attention and enough emotional weight to keep them interested. With hard rocking jams like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kill the BeastÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fight, Fight (Reach for the Sky)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Go Radio's repertoire, Lucky Street definitely makes for a promising debut from the Tallahassee quartet, and will definitely be of interest to fans of LancasterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s from his Mayday Parade days.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4510cef020396babcd83d8535714dba770b3c335","amp;dn":"Go+Radio+-+Lucky+Street+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4510cef020396babcd83d8535714dba770b3c335","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,16,206,240,32,57,107,171,205,131,216,83,87,20,219,167,112,179,195,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
