The original Wonder Woman was ahead of her time, advocating female superiority and the benefits of matriarchy in the 1940s. At the same time, her creator filled the comics with titillating bondage imagery, and Wonder Woman was tied up as often as she saved the world. In the 1950s, Wonder Woman begrudgingly continued her superheroic mission, wishing she could settle down with her boyfriend instead, all while continually hinting at hidden lesbian leanings. While other female characters stepped forward as womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lib took off in the late 1960s, Wonder Woman fell backwards, losing her superpowers and flitting from man to man. Ms. magazine and Lynda Carter restored Wonder WomanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feminist strength in the 1970s, turning her into a powerful symbol as her checkered past was quickly forgotten. Exploring this lost history adds new dimensions to the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most beloved female character, and Wonder Woman Unbound delves into her comic book and its spin-offs as well as the myriad motivations of her creators to showcase the peculiar journey that led to Wonder WomanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s iconic status.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never seen more information about Wonder Woman than in Wonder Woman Unbound! Author Tim Hanley tells us everything weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never asked about Wonder Woman because it simply never occurred to us: from her mythic Golden Age origins through her dismal Silver Age years as a lovesick romance comic character, and worse yet, when she lost her costume and powers in the late 1960s. Our favorite AmazonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s saga becomes upbeat again with the 1970s advent of Gloria Steinem and Ms Magazine, and Lynda CarterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unforgettable portrayal of her on television. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all told with a dollop of humor, thanks, Tim!&quot;- Trina Robbins, author of Pretty in Ink, North American Women Cartoonists from 1896 to 2013\n\n&quot;Wonder Woman is the sum of her parts, and all of those parts should be examined thoroughlyÃ¢â‚¬â€something this book does very well.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Bust\n\n&quot;A lively and important examination of a key feminist icon.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Booklist\n\n&quot;ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty here for Wonder Woman fans; Hanley writes with clarity and enthusiasm, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a fine eye for the goofy absurdities of comic-book narratives...&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Salon.com\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nTim Hanley is a comic book historian.
