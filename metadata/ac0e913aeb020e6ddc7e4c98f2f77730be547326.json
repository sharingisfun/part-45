Originally released only in Japan, it was later released worldwide.\n\nMade up of a series of stages, which must be unlocked in order by completing each previous stage. Through this, the player can choose their own path though the stages. Before each stage is a briefing, detailing the room where the stage takes place, the victim and area(s) on their body from which blood can be sucked, and any prevalent dangers.\n\nThe player controls a comical cartoon mosquito ('Mr. Moskeeto') and the goal of the game is to stock up on blood through the summer so that Mr. Moskeeto will survive the winter ahead. To this end Mr. Moskeeto has taken up residency in the house of the Yamada family.\n\nThe gameplay revolves around one thing: sucking blood from the Yamada family while they go about their everyday business. However, the player can only suck from a certain designated area on the body that will only be available at specific times. Each family member follows a looping set pattern of movements. Through following these movements, the player must fill a quota of blood for each stage.\n\nThe challenge in bloodsucking is that each victim has a &quot;stress meter&quot;. The player must make sure that the victim stays unaware. Sucking too fast or too slow will increase the victim's stress level. If Mr. Moskeeto is swatted while sucking blood, instant death occurs.\n\nIf the player is noticed by a victim while flying around, Battle mode begins. The victim tries to attack Mr. Moskeeto through various means. To calm them, the player must hit a number of pressure points, relieving them of tension. Once they are relaxed enough, they return to their business.\n\nThe rooms in each stage are fully explorable. Each room has items hidden in obscure places which can increase a number of things.\n\nGame Informer has named the game one of the top ten weirdest of all time Mister Mosquito was also on X-Play's list of weird games.\n\nIn 2003, a sequel called Ka 2: Let's Go To Hawaii was released in Japan. The gameplay is essentially the same as in Mister Mosquito, but adds a number of new features. It allows the player to suck blood from any part of a human's body, not just designated points. A pressure point system allows the player to suck more blood from certain points. Finally, a relaxation point system gives the player the opportunity to calm down an attacker if he is being chased\n\n\n\nPlease Enjoy + Share!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac0e913aeb020e6ddc7e4c98f2f77730be547326","amp;dn":"%7B%5B%7EPS2%7E%5D%7D+Mister+Mosquito+NTSC+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac0e913aeb020e6ddc7e4c98f2f77730be547326","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,14,145,58,235,2,14,109,220,126,76,152,242,247,119,48,190,84,115,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
