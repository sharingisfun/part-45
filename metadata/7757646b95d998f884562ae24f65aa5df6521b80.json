Ostrom (like Berglund, on his Tonbruket venture last year) avoids EST mimicry, but seeks links between the trio\\'s evolution and his own prog-rock and synth-texture roots. The influence of the Pat Metheny Group on EST surfaces in some of the pulsing grooves and swelling vocal chants ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Metheny and Berglund even make a guest appearance on the poignant Ballad for E. Otherwise, Ostrom and his new group explore pumping-heartbeat electronics that power simple, ringing melodies, quirky themes reminiscent of Zappa or early Soft Machine, plus wistful pop song or hymnal melodies, and a good deal of jazz-rock drive under whirling wah-wah guitar solos from the excellent Andreas Hourdakis. The improv is limited, and it\\'s clearly a new partnership feeling its way, but this is a more convincing start than Berglund\\'s Tonbruket.     (John Fordham)\n\n 1. Prelude\n 2.
