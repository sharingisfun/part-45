A South American drug lord pays Pace and his team to steal 48 cars for him, so they set out on the job while the police frantically try to track him down. Their efforts pay off when Pace's boss double-crosses him and tips them off on his next job. Police pursue Pace in &quot;Eleanor&quot;, the last of the cars needed to fulfill their contract, through southern California as he tries to get away.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17de822b707f6756021e6948dc7ea5b606bde3b6","amp;dn":"Deadline+auto+theft+1983+AKA+Gone+in+60+seconds+3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17de822b707f6756021e6948dc7ea5b606bde3b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,222,130,43,112,127,103,86,2,30,105,72,220,126,165,182,6,189,227,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
