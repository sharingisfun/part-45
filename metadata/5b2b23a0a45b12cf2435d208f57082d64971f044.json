Praeger | 1960 | English | 488 pages | PDF | 70 MB\r\n\r\nHere is the definitive e history of modern painting - a monumental work of unequaled scope. Unique in conception and execution. Painting in the Twentieth Century is a history not only of the world of art during the past sixty years, but of the world of ideas reflected in this art. It surveys the bold, radical developments in painting during this century.
