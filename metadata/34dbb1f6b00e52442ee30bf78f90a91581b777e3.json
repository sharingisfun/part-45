The success of his role in the Traveling Wilburys gave him a much-deserved ... \nFull Descriptionboost. Orbison had the great voice of pop and after many years of \nindifferent material he finally hit gold with great songs such as 'You Got It' \n(written with Lynne and Petty), 'Careless Heart' (written with Diane Warren) and \n'A Love So Beautiful' (written with Lynne). Orbison's tragic dedication to us when \nhe finished this album was 'don't give up before the miracle happens'. \n\nAlthough it had been years since his last recording, Roy Orbison was inducted into \nthe Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. Perhaps as a result of the newfound interest \nin his music, he was invited to record with the supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. \nOrbison had a renewed sense of purpose, and also began recording material for a new \nsolo album. Collaborating with Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty, Orbison re-creates the feel \nof his old recordings while sounding modern. His voice sounds as strong as ever, and \nhe is still able to hit the high notes that convey a sad, lonely ache. The highlight \nof the album is &quot;She's a Mystery to Me,&quot; a haunting ballad penned by U2's Bono and the \nEdge that perfectly plays to all of Orbison's strengths as a singer. Released in the \nmonths after his death, Mystery Girl was the highest-charting album of his career and \nspawned the hit &quot;You Got It&quot; -- it is a shame that Orbison was not around to experience \nhis success. This comeback album represents Roy Orbison at his best. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nemesis.1337x.org/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nemesis.1337x.org/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pow7.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pow7.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n[/code] \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34dbb1f6b00e52442ee30bf78f90a91581b777e3","amp;dn":"Roy+Orbison+-+Mystery+Girl+%28EAC+FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34dbb1f6b00e52442ee30bf78f90a91581b777e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,219,177,246,176,14,82,68,46,227,11,247,143,144,169,21,129,183,119,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
