I renamed the original scans to make it more ocd-friendly. That said, i did not scan those myself and hereby wish to thank those who did. Hope you enjoy it as much as i did, and if you do, maybe go to a store and buy the original print version.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f0dcd8ea30de177657a91a23be548b525cc2b3e","amp;dn":"Elephantmen+Up-To-Date","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f0dcd8ea30de177657a91a23be548b525cc2b3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,13,205,142,163,13,225,119,101,122,145,162,59,229,72,181,37,204,43,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
