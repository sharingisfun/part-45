The Tylenol murders case - the most extensively covered news story since the assassination of John F. Kennedy - has perplexed federal, state, and local authorities for 30 years. Now, this riveting expose tells the story not reported in the news media of an inquiry led astray from the start and marred by the mishandling and destruction of evidence. Drawing on thousands of archived news articles, police reports, court documents, interviews with the prime suspects, and interviews with authorities who were involved in the investigation, this compelling narrative provides a revelatory account of the investigation into the murders that terrorized a nation.
