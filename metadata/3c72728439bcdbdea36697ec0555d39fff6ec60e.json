You can hear the mixer messing around with the sound\nquite a bit throughout the whole show. It is not real distracting or anything. He seems to\nfinally get it right towards the end of Honky Tonk Women through the rest of the show.\nYou really get a chance to hear the Stones exactly how they sound. Very little to no crowd\nnoise at all during some of the tunes. Some tracks sound further away and some sound\ncloser. With the further away sounding ones, you can really tell they are in a dome\nstadiumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ ish. I saw this tour at both an outdoor stadium and an indoor stadium. Believe\nme, the outdoor shows are much better. Anyway, check it out because it is a good show.\nHope you enjoy!\nThe last two tracks on disc 2 are from the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢94 MTV Music Awards. They are two very solid\nperformances, sound good and are a very nice fit to complete this boot.\n\n\nTHE PLAYERS:\n\nMick Jagger ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Vocals\nCharlie Watts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Drums\nRon Wood ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar\nKeith Richards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar\nDarryl Jones ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bass\nBobby Keys ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Saxophone\nLisa Fischer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Backing Vocalist\nChuck Leavell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Keyboards\n\nTRACK LISTING:\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n  1.
