They drive vehicles, use machinery, and\nlive in amazing castles and forts. But make no mistake about it: these are animals,\nwith claws, fangs, tails, and sometimes wings. And now they are engaged in a full\nscale conflict. Once a pristine, natural paradise, the land of CHIMA has become a\nbattle ground for the animal tribes. Best friends are now worst enemies. Weaponry\npummels the once-sacred temples. Animalistic vehicles charge furiously at each other\nin jungle jousts. The animals fight for control of a natural resource called CHI, a\npower that is both a source of life and holds the potential for destruction. Only a\nfew brave heroes in CHIMA understand the true nature of CHI and its importance.\nTheir stories, and the stories of those who seek to conquer the CHI, are known as...\nTHE LEGENDS OF CHIMA.\n\nProduced by M2Film and The LEGO Group.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img43/1087/legochimas101avi.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img43/1087/legochimas101avi.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIn the mystical land of CHIMA, Laval the Lion and Cragger are the best of friends.\nAn innocent mischief results in Cragger getting his first experience with the CHI...\na powerful sacred resource important to the delicate balance of CHIMA. The CHI and\ngives awesome power to the user but needs to be spent carefully and certainly not by\nyoung adventurous animals. The incident leads to disagreements between the Lions and\nthe crocs, and ultimately to fighting. The two friends try to convince everyone that\nthis is just a big misunderstanding, but and escalating series of unfortunate events\npush Laval and Cragger apart. In the end Cragger's parents, the king and queen of\nthe crocodile tribe, fall into the Gorge of Eternal Depth and are lost. The young\nCragger is now king of the Crocodile tribe. Laval consoles him, but it seems that\nCrooler, Craggers sinister twin sister, has other plans.\n\nLEGO.Legends.of.Chima.S01E01.The.Legend.of.Chima.WEB-DL.XviD.MP3.avi\n\nVideo: Xvid 624x352 23.976fps [Qf 0.18]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo [128Kbps VBR]\nSubs: English Closed Captions (SubRip Text)\nDuration: 00:22:04\nFile size: 171 MB\n\n\n- Courtesy of Your Friendly Neighborhood...\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbe2396bed68e3327d2cb3792fd04d3cb41dfb6c","amp;dn":"LEGO.Legends.of.Chima.S01E01.The.Legend.of.Chima.WEB-DL.XviD.MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbe2396bed68e3327d2cb3792fd04d3cb41dfb6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,226,57,107,237,104,227,50,125,44,179,121,47,208,77,60,180,29,251,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
