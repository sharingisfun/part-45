Baughman's shocking video documentary ADHD - Epidemic or Fraud (1998) which exposes attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder as being an invention of &quot;modern&quot; psychiatry financed by farmaceutical cartels in order to maximize their profits. It is comprised of video footage from the National Institutes of Health, Consensus Conference on ADHD, November 16-18, 1998. BaughmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s video presentation at the conference &quot;ADHD: A Total 100% Fraud&quot; is a powerful indictment of the medical malpractice in drugging children with Ritalin, popularly administered with no concern for its life-long damaging effects. Possibly the most chilling moment in this compelling documentary occurs when a mother - almost triumphantly - announces that her own two children are under drug control. One wonders what early parenting errors and oversights secured their eventual candidacy for chemical correction. As a participant in the conference, Dr. Baughman was charging, openly, and without rebuttal, that ADHD is &quot;a total, 100% fraud.&quot; The conference lastly concluded with a confession that there was no proof that ADHD was a real disease at all. This fascinating video enables the viewer to understand the elements of the fraud that is ADHD with all of &quot;biological psychiatry&quot; and to see the perpetrators/criminals themselves. Find out how diseases can simply be invented out of thin air in order big farmaceutical cartels can stash a great deal of money from parents who later wonder what has happened to their once normal children. 60 min. A must see for everyone.
