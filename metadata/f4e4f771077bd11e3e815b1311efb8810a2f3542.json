Now he is a pilot, flying far above the earth among the stars.\n\nAct I\n A group of stars above the Sahara desert sees a sandstorm forcing the Pilot\\\\\\'s airplane to the ground. The Pilot is reflecting on the danger he is in, when a curious little boy - the Little Prince - appears. He asks the Pilot to draw him a sheep. Intrigued, the Pilot tries to learn more about him. Gradually, the Little Prince tells his story. He explains that he comes from a tiny planet, Asteroid B - 612, which is in danger of being taken over by the Baobab trees. That is why he wanted a sheep in the first place: he hopes it will eat the baobab sprouts. He is worried however, that the sheep will also eat flowers, as there is a special flower - a Rose that the Little Prince wants very much to protect.\n A flock of birds takes the Little Prince on a journey. He visits the planets of a King, a Vain Man, a Drunkard, a Business Man and a Lamplighter. The Little Prince is bewildered by the behaviour of all these grownups. Finally the Little Prince visits the planet of The Geographer, who shows no interest when the Little Prince tells him about his Rose.\n Determined to continue his travels, The Little Prince flies on to the Planet Earth.\n\nAct II\n The Little Prince arrives on Earth and meets a Snake, who mysteriously claims that with one touch he can send him back to the place from which he came. \\\\\\&quot;I\\\\\\'ll help you find your way back home\\\\\\&quot; the Snake promises. The Little Prince continues exploring Earth and finds a rose garden. He is distressed to see so many beautiful flowers, because he thought his Rose was the only one for her kind. Fox - hunters appear with their guns.\n Once they have gone, their quarry comes out of hiding. The Little Prince asks the Fox to play with him. But the Fox refuses, saying \\\\\\&quot;I\\\\\\'ve not been tamed.\\\\\\&quot; The Little Prince learns what \\\\\\&quot;taming\\\\\\&quot; means. \\\\\\&quot;Tamers care for what they\\\\\\'ve tamed. You\\\\\\'ll always be responsible for your Rose,\\\\\\&quot; the Fox explains. The Little Prince realises that his Rose is, after all, unique, because of his love for her. He has finished recounting his adventures, and the Pilot reminds him that it\\\\\\'s been eight days since his plane went down and they are running out of water. They set off in search of a well, and are saved by the Water they find. But the Little Prince\\\\\\'s visit to Earth is coming to an end. He explains that it is time for him to return to his planet. He reassures the Pilot that he is not about to die, and that his body is just a shell: \\\\\\&quot;Anything essential is invisible to the eye.\\\\\\&quot;\n The Snake strikes and the Little Prince disappears, leaving the Pilot alone in the desert. The Pilot addresses the audience: \\\\\\&quot;Wait a while beneath a star, and if a child arrives with golden hair, who laughs and disappears, make sure you tell me he\\\\\\'s returned.\\\\\\&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4e4f771077bd11e3e815b1311efb8810a2f3542","amp;dn":"The_Little_Prince","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4e4f771077bd11e3e815b1311efb8810a2f3542","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,228,247,113,7,123,209,30,62,129,91,19,17,239,184,129,10,47,53,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
