Combining this with their own personal style, we have seen teams reach new heights of success from FC Barcelona to Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund and, most recently, the German National Team at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. But what does it take to learn this 'art' of passing? What are the methodological and technical requirements for becoming the new Schweinsteiger, Messi, or Neuer? In this book, the only of its kind, two German League certified coaches have created the ultimate guide to passing. Using the &quot;Hyballa-te Poel-Passing-Puzzle,&quot; they present every type of pass there is in modern soccer, with lots of drills for each type. From the goalkeeper to the center forward, everyone can learn passing with these exercises","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a50a45dd8f10f83c7e916f1037fd36d7d8052af3","amp;dn":"German+Soccer+Passing+Drills+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a50a45dd8f10f83c7e916f1037fd36d7d8052af3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,10,69,221,143,16,248,60,126,145,111,16,55,253,54,215,216,5,42,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
