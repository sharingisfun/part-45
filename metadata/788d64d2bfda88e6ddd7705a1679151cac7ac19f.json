The weres and shifters have finally decided to reveal their existence to the ordinary world. At first all goes well. Then the mutilated body of a were-panther is found near the bar where Sookie works-and she feels compelled to discover who, human or otherwise, did it.\n\nBut there's a far greater danger threatening Bon Temps. A race of unhuman beings-older, more powerful, and more secretive than vampires or werewolves-is preparing for war. And Sookie finds herself an all-too human pawn in their battle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:788d64d2bfda88e6ddd7705a1679151cac7ac19f","amp;dn":"Dead+and+Gone+-+Charlaine+Harris-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"788d64d2bfda88e6ddd7705a1679151cac7ac19f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,141,100,210,191,218,136,230,221,215,112,90,22,121,21,28,172,122,193,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
