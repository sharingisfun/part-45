At the time it was a high quality pressing and when it finally came out on CD my concern was that the glorious sound of the original would get lost in some engineer's idea of what live music should sound like. \n\nFortunately, I need not have worried, Concord did a great job in keeping the essence of the live performance on the CD. \n\nThis is a unique line-up for the Brubeck Quartet with Dave, Chris Brubeck on bass, Randy Jones on drums and Bill Smith on clarinet. That's right, I said clarinet. And it worked! You get the feeling that these four guys just like playing with one another. There's an easiness about the performance that only seems to happen when musicians are having a good time playing together. \n\nThe songs on this CD are all of good quality, but the killer is 'Softly William, Softly' that knocks the audience on its butt. This leads into the closing version of Take Five that has the audience out of their chairs. \n\nOverall this is a 5 star performance and makes you wonder what it must have been like to be there on that magical Summer Night in Concord... ~ J. Bransfield\n\nThis is my favorite live jazz recording, if not one of the best of all time! There is some mesmerizing playing on this album, including the remarkable drum solo on the last track by Randy Jones. 'Benjamin' really flies, but on 'Koto Song' Brubeck plays some really poignant, introspective solos. You don't know Dave Brubeck until you listen to this album, and feel like you were there on that summer night way back in 1982. The sound quality of this cd is amazing. Get this one! ~ A Minstrel in the Gallery 'Chris'\n\nPersonnel:\nDave Brubeck, Piano;\nBill Smith, Clarinet;\nChris Brubeck, Guitar, Electric Bass, Bass Trombone;\nRandy Jones, Drums;\nBill Airey Smith, Clarinet.\n\nDave Brubeck - Concord On A Summer Night (1982) Tracks:\n01  Benjamin ( Brubeck ) 6:03\n02  Koto Song ( Brubeck ) 9:00\n03  Black and Blue ( Brooks, Razaf, Waller ) 7:21\n04  Softly, William, Softly ( Brubeck ) 8:00\n05  Take Five ( Desmond ) 9:08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7c4380d3e8363dde964296628fd3bf8f5053f43","amp;dn":"Dave+Brubeck+-+Concord+On+A+Summer+Night+%281982%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7c4380d3e8363dde964296628fd3bf8f5053f43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,196,56,13,62,131,99,221,233,100,41,102,40,253,59,248,245,5,63,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
