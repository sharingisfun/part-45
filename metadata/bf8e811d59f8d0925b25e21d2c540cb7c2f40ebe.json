Pedal steel player Feeny and banjo artist Patch Boyle add a distinctly &quot;country&quot; vibe, while bass player Tracee and drummer Lisa Jannon keep the rhythm in check. \n\nAll in all this is a wonderful album for anyone who is interested in the diversity that can be obtained when not limiting yourself to a label of rock and roll or country. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf8e811d59f8d0925b25e21d2c540cb7c2f40ebe","amp;dn":"Blanche...If+We+Can%5C%27t+Trust+the+Doctors%282004%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf8e811d59f8d0925b25e21d2c540cb7c2f40ebe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,142,129,29,89,248,208,146,91,37,226,29,44,84,12,183,194,244,14,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
