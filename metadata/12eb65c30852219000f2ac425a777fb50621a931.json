This concise book shows you how to use Apple's Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) to simplify programming on multicore iOS devices and Mac OS X.\n\nManaging your applicationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s resources on more than one core isn't easy, but it's vital. Apps that use only one core in a multicore environment will slow to a crawl. If you know how to program with Cocoa or Cocoa Touch, this guide will get you started with GCD right away, with many examples to help you write high-performing multithreaded apps.\n\nPackage your code as block objects and invoke them with GCD\nUnderstand dispatch queuesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the pools of threads managed by GCD\nUse different methods for executing UI and non-UI tasks\nCreate a group of tasks that GCD can run all at once\nInstruct GCD to execute tasks only once or after a delay\nDiscover how to construct your own dispatch queues\nAbout the Author\nVandad Nahavandipoor has developed software using Cocoa, Cocoa Touch, Assembly, Delphi, and .NET for many years.
