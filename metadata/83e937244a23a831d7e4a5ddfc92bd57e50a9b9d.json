Islands of Memory is their 1st full album following their digital releases from Dewtone Recordings (CAN) and Kahvi Collective (UK), comprising 78 minutes of deep sinking beats and drifting beautiful melodies like cold melting graciers. All of the tracks are carefully produced experimenting with synthesis of various trends of electronic music. As you listen through the tracks, you will feel this pleasurous energy gradually covering up your body and senses.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83e937244a23a831d7e4a5ddfc92bd57e50a9b9d","amp;dn":"Advanced+Dreams+-+Islands+Of+Memory+%282014%29+FLAC%2BMP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83e937244a23a831d7e4a5ddfc92bd57e50a9b9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,233,55,36,74,35,168,49,215,228,165,221,252,146,189,87,229,10,155,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
