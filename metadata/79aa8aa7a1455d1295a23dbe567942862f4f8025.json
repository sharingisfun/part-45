Can be opened, played and edited in Audacity. Some songs from the KH1 OST (Hikari, credits music, etc.) are missing, presumably because they're tied into the pre-rendered FMVs and so cannot be extracted, as such. Don't think those were changed either way though.\n\nNote that I said RAW, so they're unlooped, and you'll probably find split songs, duplicates, etc.; I'm leaving the adjusting and clean-up for someone else, since I don't have the time or patience. I just nametagged the songs so you could find them easily. Feel free to upload an improved version if you can fix everything.\n\nI cannot for the life of me figure out where the last four tracks in the KH1 section are from but I'm assuming they're fragments from the songs listed above.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79aa8aa7a1455d1295a23dbe567942862f4f8025","amp;dn":"Kingdom+Hearts+HD+1.5+ReMIX+raw+music%2Fsound+rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79aa8aa7a1455d1295a23dbe567942862f4f8025","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,170,138,167,161,69,93,18,149,162,61,190,86,121,66,134,47,79,128,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
