G. Ballard is \na landmark event. Increasingly recognized as one of the greatest and \nmost prophetic novelists, J. G. Ballard was a &quot;writer of enormous inventive \npowers,&quot; who, in the words of Malcolm Bradbury, possessed, &quot;like Calvino, \na remarkable gift for filling the empty deprived spaces of modern life \nwith the invisible cities and the wonder worlds of imagination.&quot;\n\nBest known for his novels, such as Empire of the Sun and Crash, Ballard \nrose to fame as the &quot;ideal chronicler of disturbed modernity&quot; (The Observer). \nPerhaps less known, though equally brilliant, were his devastatingly \noriginal short stories, which span nearly fifty years and reveal an \nunparalleled prescience so unique that a new word-Ballardian-had to \nbe invented. Ballard, who wrote that &quot;short stories are the loose change \nin the treasury of fiction, easily ignored beside the wealth of novels \navailable,&quot; regretted the fact that the public had increasingly lost \nits ability to appreciate them.\n\nWith 98 pulse-quickening stories, this volume helps restore the very \nart form that Ballard feared was comatose. Ballard's inimitable style \nwas already present in his early stories, most of them published in \nscience fiction magazines. These stories are surreal, richly atmospheric \nand splendidly elliptical, featuring an assortment of psychotropic houses, \ntime-traveling assassins, and cities without clocks. Over the next fifty \nyears, his fierce imaginative energy propelled him to explore new topics, \nincluding the dehumanization of technology, the brutality of the corporation, \nand nuclear Armageddon. Depicting the human soul as &quot;being enervated \nand corrupted by the modern world&quot; (New York Times), Ballard began to \nexamine themes like overpopulation, as in &quot;Billenium,&quot; a claustrophobic \nimagining of a world of 20 billion people crammed into four-square-meter \nrooms, or the false realities of modern media, as in the classic &quot;Why \nI Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan,&quot; a faux-psychological study of the sexual \nand violent reactions elicited by viewing Reagan's face on television, \nin which Ballard predicted the unholy fusion of pop culture and sound-bite \npolitics thirteen years before Reagan became president. Given Ballard's \nheightened powers of perception, it is astonishing that the dehumanized \nworld that he apprehended so acutely neither diminished his own febrile \nimagination nor his engagement with mankind, evident in every story, \nincluding two new ones for this American edition.\n\nSo eerily prophetic is his vision, so commanding are his literary gifts, \nthe import and insight of J. G. Ballard's deeply humanistic and transcendent \nworks can only grow in years to come.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nIntroduction by Martin Amis\nAuthor's Introduction\n1.\tPrima Belladonna\n2.\tEscapement\n3.\tThe Concentration City\n4.\tVenus Smiles\n5.\tManhole 69\n6.\tTrack 12\n7.\tThe Waiting Grounds\n8.\tNow : Zero\n9.\tThe Sound-Sweep\n10.\tZone of Terror\n11.\tChronopolis\n12.\tThe Voices of Time\n13.\tThe Last World of Mr. Goddard\n14.\tStudio 5, the Stars\n15.\tDeep End\n16.\tThe Overloaded Man\n17.\tMr. F Is Mr. F\n18.\tBillennium\n19.\tThe Gentle Assassin\n20.\tThe Insane Ones\n21.\tThe Garden of Time\n22.\tThe Thousand Dreams of Stellavista\n23.\tThirteen to Centaurus\n24.\tPassport to Eternity\n25.\tThe Cage of Sand\n26.\tThe Watch-Towers\n27.\tThe Singing Statues\n28.\tThe Man on the 99th Floor\n29.\tThe Subliminal Man\n30.\tThe Reptile Enclosure\n31.\tA Question of Re-Entry\n32.\tThe Time-Tombs\n33.\tNow Wakes the Sea\n34.\tThe Venus Hunters\n35.\tEnd-Game\n36.\tMinus One\n37.\tThe Sudden Afternoon\n38.\tThe Screen Game\n39.\tTime of Passage\n40.\tPrisoner of the Coral Deep\n41.\tThe Lost Leonardo\n42.\tThe Terminal Beach\n43.\tThe Illuminated Man\n44.\tThe Delta at Sunset\n45.\tThe Drowned Giant\n46.\tThe Gioconda of the Twilight Noon\n47.\tThe Volcano Dances\n48.\tThe Beach Murders\n49.\tThe Day of Forever\n50.\tThe Impossible Man\n51.\tStorm-Bird, Storm-Dreamer\n52.\tTomorrow Is a Million Years\n53.\tThe Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race\n54.\tCry Hope, Cry Fury!\n55.\tThe Recognition\n56.\tThe Cloud-Sculptors of Coral D\n57.\tWhy I Want To Fuck Ronald Reagan\n58.\tThe Dead Astronaut\n59.\tThe Comsat Angels\n60.\tThe Killing Ground\n61.\tA Place and a Time To Die\n62.\tSay Goodbye to the Wind\n63.\tThe Greatest Television Show on Earth\n64.\tMy Dream of Flying to Wake Island\n65.\tThe Air Disaster\n66.\tLow-flying Aircraft\n67.\tThe Life and Death of God\n68.\tNotes towards a Mental Breakdown\n69.\tThe 60 Minute Zoom\n70.\tThe Smile\n71.\tThe Ultimate City\n72.\tThe Dead Time\n73.\tThe Index\n74.\tThe Intensive Care Unit\n75.\tTheatre of War\n76.\tHaving a Wonderful Time\n77.\tOne Afternoon at Utah Beach\n78.\tZodiac 2000\n79.\tMotel Architecture\n80.\tA Host of Furious Fancies\n81.\tNews from the Sun\n82.\tMemories of the Space Age\n83.\tMyths of the Near Future\n84.\tReport on an Unidentified Space Station\n85.\tThe Object of the Attack\n86.\tAnswers to a Questionnaire\n87.\tThe Man Who Walked on the Moon\n88.\tThe Secret History of World War 3\n89.\tLove in a Colder Climate\n90.\tThe Enormous Space\n91.\tThe Largest Theme Park in the World\n92.\tWar Fever\n93.\tDream Cargoes\n94.\tA Guide to Virtual Death\n95.\tThe Message from Mars\n96.\tReport from an Obscure Planet\n\nNew Stories for the American Edition:\n97.\tThe Secret Autobiography of J.G.B.\n98.\tThe Dying Fall\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e356a59610496a94aad6b4e2c2880a3246362cd0","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Stories+of+J.+G.+Ballard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e356a59610496a94aad6b4e2c2880a3246362cd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,86,165,150,16,73,106,148,170,214,180,226,194,136,10,50,70,54,44,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
