It takes place in the High Dale in the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign setting, although it can easily be placed in any AD&amp;D campaign as a beginning scenario. This adventure is designed to prepare zero-level PCs for the character classes that will most suit them when they reach 1st level. The plot centers on the urd, a monster detailed in the Monstrous Compendium.\r\n\r\nconverted to 5e, and ported to fantasy grounds. Suitable for level 1-2 pcs.\r\n\r\nPlease seed.\r\n\r\nAlso if you use it, please consider taking some time to convert another old Dungeon adventure and post it hereabouts, in trade. It took a really long time, but if everyone did one they'd be converted in no time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4026b0fbdd6525c4da92d41f757438f3233ba3a","amp;dn":"Fantasy+Grounds+5e+Adventure+Module%3A+Below+Vulture+Point","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4026b0fbdd6525c4da92d41f757438f3233ba3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,2,107,15,189,214,82,92,77,169,45,65,247,87,67,143,50,51,186,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
