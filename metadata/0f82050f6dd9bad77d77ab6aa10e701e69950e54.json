Fully dramatised tales introduced by Malcolm McDowell.\n\nThe Late Shift by Dennis Etchinson\n\nEver wonder what the dead might have to say when they are alone with each other? It turns out that the dead are neither comical nor menacing. They are just tired and lost and in search of peace. They are people like you and me who want to rest now that their work is done. The problem is, the system wants to continue to exploit them even beyond death. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a grim proposition but the logical extension of our society when a sinister company reanimates corpses in order to provide free labor for the late night shifts in stores and garages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f82050f6dd9bad77d77ab6aa10e701e69950e54","amp;dn":"Dreadtime+Stories%3A+The+Late+Shift","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f82050f6dd9bad77d77ab6aa10e701e69950e54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,130,5,15,109,217,186,215,125,119,171,106,161,14,112,30,105,149,14,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
