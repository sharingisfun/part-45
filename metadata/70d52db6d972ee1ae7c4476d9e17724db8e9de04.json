Jealous and sensing ulterior motives in Fitz's (Shawn Ashmore) return to Toronto, Chen (Byron Mann) confronts him with a stash of love letters he wrote to Ming (Mayko Nguyen). The two come to blows then reflect back on a time during their residency when they helped each other out during a Code Blue. At the ensuing peer assessment review, Fitz takes stock of his mettle as a doctor, his motives as a friend and his true feelings for Ming.\n\nThe resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion. \n\n\nMore information on this show is here: http://www.hbocanada.com/bloodletting/index.php\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70d52db6d972ee1ae7c4476d9e17724db8e9de04","amp;dn":"Bloodletting.and.Miraculous.Cures.S01E03.WS.XviD-err0001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70d52db6d972ee1ae7c4476d9e17724db8e9de04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,213,45,182,217,114,238,26,231,196,71,109,158,23,114,77,184,233,222,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
