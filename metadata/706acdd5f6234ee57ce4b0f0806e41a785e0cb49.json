Though the documentary is centred on the history of Auschwitz concentration and extermination camp, it also explains the Holocaust as a whole. 'Auschwitz' is made up of 4 elements: Dramatic reconstruction with native actors, high quality computer generated imagery, interviews of eye-witnesses, and astonishing archive footage. The actors play honestly their characters, and perfectly show the unforgivable and cold minded zeal of SS men. The interviews of (former?) Nazis and victims give a crucial human touch to this documentary. The BBC proves, one more time, that quality can go along with TV programme. \n\n\n\n\nMount Or Burn IMAGE File\n\n\n\nDON'T FORGET TO COMMENT &amp; SEED\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:706acdd5f6234ee57ce4b0f0806e41a785e0cb49","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Auschwitz+The+Nazis+and+the+Final+Solution+Disc+2+Of+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"706acdd5f6234ee57ce4b0f0806e41a785e0cb49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,106,205,213,246,35,78,229,124,228,176,240,128,110,65,167,133,224,203,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
