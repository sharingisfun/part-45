It capitalizes on our \n\nobsession with accessorizing meals using quality ingredients in inspired, varied, and memorable recipes. Every recipe offers multiple entrÃƒÂ©e \n\nsuggestions and helps cooks design an entire meal. Instead of tagging bland afterthoughts on your plate at the last minute, you can create exciting \n\ncombinations.\nThe chapters offer a range of recipes for broad appeal, crossing cuisines, techniques, and complexity. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find recipes for breakfast, intimate \n\ngatherings, picnics, holidays, and more. Coconut Cilantro Toasted Israeli Couscous, Pumpkin Cozy Rolls, Honey Balsamic Peaches and Burrata, \n\nand Sesame Braised Bok Choy are just a few. A helpful chart, organized by main entrÃƒÂ©e, gives you a quick look at what to serve with chicken, \n\nbeef, fish, and the like. Choosing Sides is a singular source for answering the mealtime question, Ã¢â‚¬Å“What should I serve with this?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img41/74/t571.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img41/74/t571.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nTara Mataraza Desmond writes about food, cooking, and nutritious eating.
