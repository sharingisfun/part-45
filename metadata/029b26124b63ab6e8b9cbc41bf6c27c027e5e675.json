It competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.\nIn 16th-century Russia in the grip of chaos, Ivan the Terrible strongly believes he is vested with a holy mission. Believing he can understand and interpret the signs, he sees the Last Judgment approaching. He establishes absolute power, cruelly destroying anyone who gets in his way. During this reign of terror, Philip, the superior of the monastery on the Solovetsky Islands, a great scholar and Ivan's close friend, dares to oppose the sovereign's mystical tyranny. What follows is a clash between two completely opposite visions of the world, smashing morality and justice, God and men. A grand-scale film with excellent leading roles by Mamonov and Yankovsky. An allegory of Stalinist Russia.\nCast\n\nPyotr Mamonov as Ivan The Terrible\nOleg Yankovskiy as Metropolitan Philip Kolychev\nAnastasiya Dontsova as Masha\nAleksandr Domogarov as Aleksei Basmanov\nAleksandr Ilyin as Fedka Basmanov\nRamilya Iskander as Maria Temryukovna\nVille Haapasalo as Heinrich von Staden\nAleksei Frandetti as Kai-Bulat\nIvan Okhlobystin as Vassian\nYuri Kuznetsov as Malyuta Skuratov\nAleksei Makarov as General Kolychev","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:029b26124b63ab6e8b9cbc41bf6c27c027e5e675","amp;dn":"Tsar+-+2009%28Eng+subs%29..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"029b26124b63ab6e8b9cbc41bf6c27c027e5e675","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,155,38,18,75,99,171,110,139,156,188,65,191,108,39,192,39,229,230,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
