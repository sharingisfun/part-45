Like most teenagers, Peter is trying to figure out who he is and how he got to be the person he is today. As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents' disappearance - leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors (Ifans), his father's former partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors' alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering choices to use his powers and shape his destiny to become a hero. -- (C) Sony","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79796568f55c3cb1a09a358ba8061872e91183eb","amp;dn":"the+amazing+spiderman+2012+%5B1080p%5D+brrip+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79796568f55c3cb1a09a358ba8061872e91183eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,121,101,104,245,92,60,177,160,154,53,139,168,6,24,114,233,17,131,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
