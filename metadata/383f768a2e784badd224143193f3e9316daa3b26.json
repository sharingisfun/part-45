Then a guest at the villa - a young woman he had instantly and innocently warmed to - disappears on a mountain peak. Under suspicion of her murder, Harry stumbles on a set of photographs taken by Heather Mallender in the weeks before her disappearance. Desperately, obsessed by the mystery that has changed his life, he begins to trace back the movements and encounters that led to the moment when she vanished into the blue. The trail leads him back to England, to a world he thought he had left for ever, and at every step of the way a new and baffling light is shed on all the assumptions that have made Harry what he is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:383f768a2e784badd224143193f3e9316daa3b26","amp;dn":"Into+the+Blue+-+Robert+Goddard++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"383f768a2e784badd224143193f3e9316daa3b26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,63,118,138,46,120,75,173,210,36,20,49,147,243,233,49,109,170,59,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
