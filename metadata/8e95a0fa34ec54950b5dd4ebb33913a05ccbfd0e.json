That we are moving from bad to worse, and from worse to the worst, for no day elapses but its morrow is still eviler, until the Last Hour befalls. \n \nUndoubtedly, this is a grave mistake that arises from a misconception of what is stated in some partial text passages combined with an omission of many conclusive crystal-clear auspices that the future belongs to Islam and Allah will surely make that religion superior over all other religions, however deeply averse disbelievers are to it.\n \nTherefore, we must discuss these (Auspices) and spread them amongst the Muslims, in order to inspire hope that motivates willpower and defeat despair that kills souls.\n \nThanks to Allah these auspices are many. Some of them are quoted from the Noble QurÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢an and the Muhammadan Sunnah, while others are derived from history, the actual time and the Laws of Allah in His Creation.\n \nWe shall discuss each of these auspices in the next pages as Allah may bestow.\n                      \n          Penned by\nDoctor YÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â»suf Al-QaradÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢wy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e95a0fa34ec54950b5dd4ebb33913a05ccbfd0e","amp;dn":"Auspices+Of+The+Ultimate+Victory+Of+Islam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e95a0fa34ec54950b5dd4ebb33913a05ccbfd0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,149,160,250,52,236,84,149,11,93,212,235,179,57,19,160,92,203,253,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
