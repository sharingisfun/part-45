Yet there is a tradition of American anti-imperialism that exposes this misleading mythology. American Insurgents is a surprising, revelatory history of anti-imperialism in the United States since the American Revolution. It charts the movements against empire from the Indian Wars and the expansionism of the slave South to the Anti-Imperialist League of Mark Twain and Jane Addams. Seymour crafts a lively and transparent explanation of why some of these movements succeeded and others failed. The result is a vital perspective for those organizing antiwar resistance today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10e9a7021c5c3859acb38262f257332a74f90573","amp;dn":"American+Insurgents+A+Brief+History+of+American+Anti-Imperialism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10e9a7021c5c3859acb38262f257332a74f90573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,233,167,2,28,92,56,89,172,179,130,98,242,87,51,42,116,249,5,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
