The band had broken up in April 1971 due to differences between singer Paul Rodgers and bassist Andy Fraser but had now reformed\n\nAll members of the band made a concerted effort to work smoothly and efficiently for guitarist Paul Kossoff's sake as he was suffering due to an addiction to Mandrax (Quaaludes). \nFor example, in a symbolic gesture all tracks were credited to every member of the band regardless of who actually wrote them.\n\nThe attitude to the songwriting was also vastly different; there are no outright rock songs at all, and the three songs that contain fast-paced moments all have slower, more introspective moments. \nAlso, many fans have interpreted some of the melancholic lyrics (many of which concern people in some form of emotional distress) as referring to Kossoff\n\nArtist: Free\n\nTitle Of Album: Free At Last\n\nYear Of Release: 2015\nLabel: Culture Factory\n\nGenre: Rock, Blues Rock\nFormat: Mp3\n\nQuality: 320 kbps\n\nTotal Time: 65:39 Min\nTotal Size: 162 Mb\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 Catch A Train 3:32\n02 Soldier Boy 2:51\n03 Magic Ship 5:22\n04 Sail On 3:05\n05 Travelling Man 3:23\n06 Little Bit Of Love 2:34\n07 Guardian Of The Universe 5:32\n08 Child 5:18\n09 Goodbye 5:15\n10 BurninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Molten Gold) (Alternative Take) 5:57\n11 Honky Tonk Women 3:13\n12 Magic Ships (Alternative Mix) 5:27\n13 Little Bit Of Love (Alternative Mix) 2:37\n14 Guardian Of The Universe (Paul Rodgers Solo Version) 6:06\n15 Child (Early Mix) 5:19\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n    Paul Rodgers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, piano\n    Paul Kossoff Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n    Andy Fraser Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar\n    Simon Kirke Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:835faedbe1bc27c175a007b746f5b4e58e050e78","amp;dn":"Free+-+Free+At+Last+1972+%28Collector%27s+Edition%29+-+2015+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"835faedbe1bc27c175a007b746f5b4e58e050e78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,95,174,219,225,188,39,193,117,160,7,183,70,245,180,229,142,5,14,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
