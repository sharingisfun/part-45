The book contains everything that you need to know to learn the basics of Excel and then move on to more advanced topics at your own pace. You?ll find many useful examples and lots of tips and tricks that I?ve accumulated over the years.\n\nIn this book, I?ve tried to maintain a good balance between the basics that every Excel user needs to know and the more complex topics that will appeal to power users. I?ve used Excel for nearly 20 years, and I realize that almost everyone still has something to learn (including myself). My goal is to make that learning an enjoyable process.\n\nThis book was written for Excel 2007 for Windows. No exceptions. If you?re using an older version of Excel, I suggest that you put down this book immediately and find a book that?s appropriate for your version of Excel. The changes in Excel 2007 are so extensive that you?ll probably be hopelessly confused if you use an earlier version.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENT:\nPart 1 - Getting Started with Excel\nPart 2 - Working with Formulas and Functions\nPart 3 - Creating Charts and Graphics\nPart 4 - Using Advanced Excel Features\nPart 5 - Analyzing Data with Excel\nPart 6 - Programming Excel with VBA\nPart 7 - Appendixes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80827a97521891958ea8ed29100742b5948f6bb6","amp;dn":"Excel+2007+Bible-pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80827a97521891958ea8ed29100742b5948f6bb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,130,122,151,82,24,145,149,142,168,237,41,16,7,66,181,148,143,107,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
