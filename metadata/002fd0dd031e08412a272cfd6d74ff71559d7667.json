Tried a few tricks but all have failed so far.\nThe last file command in each .bat has the restart switch, so you will be prompted to restart the computer after the last update is installed in each folder\n\nSilverlight can be ignored or installed at any time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:002fd0dd031e08412a272cfd6d74ff71559d7667","amp;dn":"Windows+7+Ultimate+sp1+x64+all+updates+to+15-9-12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"002fd0dd031e08412a272cfd6d74ff71559d7667","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,47,208,221,3,30,8,65,42,39,44,253,109,116,255,113,85,157,118,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
