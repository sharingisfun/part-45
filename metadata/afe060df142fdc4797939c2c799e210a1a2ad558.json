Playing upon the socialistic themes that were so prevalent at the beginning of the 20th century, &quot;The Iron Heel&quot; tells the story of a wealthy class that squeezes out the middle class and effectively rules for three centuries until a revolution ushers in the &quot;Brotherhood of Man&quot;. As important a commentary today as when it was first written, London's novel is a chilling depiction of a possible future world and an excellent exposition on the struggle between socio-economic classes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afe060df142fdc4797939c2c799e210a1a2ad558","amp;dn":"The+Iron+Heel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afe060df142fdc4797939c2c799e210a1a2ad558","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,224,96,223,20,47,220,71,151,147,156,44,121,158,33,10,26,42,213,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
