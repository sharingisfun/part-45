I dropped the source into vdubmod. I used a smoother on a very light setting to clean the video up without losing to much detail. Then i lowered the contrast &amp; gamma. After that i increased the saturation &amp; brightness a little bit. The last thing i done to the video was, changed the colours with a rgb eq i spent hours at this. Finally i muxed imagines cam audio. Im not happy with the colours, but i spent ages changing them and trying different thing out, &amp; i think it looks better this way. You do get some very bright parts in the video (like you did in yogi bear) but there was nothing i could do about this without making the rest of the video very dark.\n\nHere is a screenshot comparison between mine &amp; the source.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/18739&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/18739&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHere is a screenshot comparison between mine &amp; imagines copy\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/18902&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/18902&lt;/a&gt;\n\ncredit iLLUSiON &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, IPTORRENTS, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic, FASAMOO, W1CK3D1NT3Z, GRIND3R, extremezone, MonsterTV, BLaZE, SAFCuk009, Fabreezy, MXMG, Hellb0y, iwanttobelieveinaj, velvetfog, mustaphanaru, greenbud1969 &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/1008/64189788.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/1008/64189788.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img190.imageshack.us/img190/374/53797629.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img190.imageshack.us/img190/374/53797629.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img510.imageshack.us/img510/300/70463102.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img510.imageshack.us/img510/300/70463102.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img257.imageshack.us/img257/3954/34806882.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img257.imageshack.us/img257/3954/34806882.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/3475/47379393.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/3475/47379393.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDON'T THANK US...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479997/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479997/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e9abf59b764296eb45a1405035c732c05107e1f","amp;dn":"Season+Of+The+Witch+2011+CAM+XviD-iLLUSiON%28Kingdom-Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e9abf59b764296eb45a1405035c732c05107e1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,154,191,89,183,100,41,110,180,90,20,5,3,92,115,44,5,16,126,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
