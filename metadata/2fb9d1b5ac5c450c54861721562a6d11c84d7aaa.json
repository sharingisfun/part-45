They are obsessed with sex, TV, heavy-metal rock 'n roll, sex, coolness and sex, in that order. The trouble begins when the couch-potato duo's beloved television disappears (they assume it was stolen). In the course of trying to get another TV, they get involved in a major arms-smuggling scheme and are chased all over the U.S. by mobsters and lawmen alike. In one of the movie's highlights, Butt-head tries to get Chelsea Clinton to go to bed with him. Apparently he believes that since they both wear braces, she will naturally want to have sex with him.\n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter and Autogk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fb9d1b5ac5c450c54861721562a6d11c84d7aaa","amp;dn":"Beavis+and+Butthead+Do+America%281996%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fb9d1b5ac5c450c54861721562a6d11c84d7aaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,185,209,181,172,92,69,12,84,134,23,33,86,42,109,17,200,77,122,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
