Eventually over 8,000 were sent off to German concentration camps. As 10-year old Sarah and her family are being arrested, she hides her younger brother in a closet. After realizing she will not be allowed to go home, Sarah does whatever she can to get back to her brother. In 2009, a journalist named Julia is on assignment to write a story on the deported Jews in 1942. When she moves into her father-in-law's childhood apartment, she realizes it once belonged to the Strazynski family, and their daughter Sarah. \n\n\nLanguages: French / English / Italian / German / Hebrew\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / French / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:998a2cc4e4499c9337469e4bbfcdc528b3ad5eed","amp;dn":"Elle+s+Appelait+Sarah+aka+Sarah+s+Key+2010+DVDRip+Sonata+Premier","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"998a2cc4e4499c9337469e4bbfcdc528b3ad5eed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,138,44,196,228,73,156,147,55,70,158,75,191,205,197,40,179,173,94,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
