On\nthis album, he is in the excellent company of Darius Jones on alto saxophone\nand Vijay Anderson on drums. This is the first album Lane has done to date that\nwas totally improvised in the studio and it provides the group with a large\ncanvas on which to create their music. This format definitely plays to their\nstrengths as they display on Ã¢â‚¬Å“StarsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ where whirlpools of sound descend like\nwild dervishes with saxophone and bowed bass leading the charge. &quot;The Great\nGlass Elevator&quot; moves dynamically through raw blowing and subtle bass playing,\nwhile Ã¢â‚¬Å“Run to InfinityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ develops from a cautious beginning to a torrid\ncollective improvisation. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Apparent HorizonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ develops patiently at length,\nfeaturing billowing saxophone, rolling drums and thick elastic bass. There is a\nspacious midsection fraught with tension, waiting for the finale which is a\nlong blowing emotive saxophone and drums. Ã¢â‚¬Å“BioluminescenceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ adds subtle\nelectronics to the mix, as if the music had begun to glow itself. This is an\nexperimental track that works well, with bass and drums building an excellent\nfoundation. Raw saxophone weaves through the maelstrom, deep and\npowerful. Ã¢â‚¬Å“LightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ finishes the album with a  fast paced trio improvisation,\ndeveloping very nimble bass and drums with flurries of saxophone gliding\noverhead. This was a gutsy move for Adam Lane to develop a totally improvised\nLP but it works very well. The musicians are locked in deeply and support each\nother throughout.\n\n--\n\nBy Dan Sorrells &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2013/10/adam-lane-trio-absolute-horizon.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2013/10/adam-lane-trio-absolute-horizon.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Glenn Astarita &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/absolute-horizon-adam-lane-nobusiness-records-review-by-glenn-astarita.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/absolute-horizon-adam-lane-nobusiness-records-review-by-glenn-astarita.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Grego Applegate Edwards\n\nPar Luc Bouquet (fr)\n\nPor Pachi Tapiz (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/web/?p=9751&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/web/?p=9751&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4aea346baaf5c35c882d79aa12900fbac3739fdf","amp;dn":"Adam+Lane+Trio+-+Absolute+Horizon+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4aea346baaf5c35c882d79aa12900fbac3739fdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,234,52,107,170,245,195,92,136,45,121,170,18,144,15,186,195,115,159,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
