Morano is in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as the man-made climate change secretariats convene under the globalist umbrella of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development and Earth Summit 2012.\n[NOTE: Marc Morano was scheduled, but did not appear due to communication problems.]\n\nAlex also covers important news stories of the day, including the secret Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, Rubio's vetting by the Bilderbergers as Romney's running mate, and Ron Paul's assertion that he will not support the establishment Republican choice to run against his ideological cousin fronted by the Democrats. \n\nAlex also talks with radio host Mancow Muller on today's worldwide transmission.     \n\n[NOTE: Although not mentioned in theshow description, Alex talks at length (from 12:00 in hour 2 through 17:00 in hour 3) with Dr. Peter Glidden. The Glidden interview is in large part an infomercial for Alex's supplement marketing web site (infowarsteam.com) and the Youngevity products sold there.]\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bdae713345c994d18b11b7d615e9a357f21d109","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones+Show+-+2012+June+20+WE+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bdae713345c994d18b11b7d615e9a357f21d109","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,218,231,19,52,92,153,77,24,177,27,125,97,94,154,53,127,33,209,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
