It was indeed worth the wait, spot-welding blinding speed and immaculate chops that went in a million different directions (jazz, country, rockabilly, blues, you name it) to a musical sensibility that made this all-instrumental album a whole lot more than just yer average fretboard wanking jam-fest. Gatton's Telecaster really shines on diverse material ranging from Martin Denny's &quot;Quiet Village&quot; to the roadhouse shuffle &quot;Funky Mama&quot; to the off-the-wall rendition of the theme to The Simpsons. Kudos to Elektra for having the corporate balls to put this out; short, chunky, and middle-aged, Danny Gatton was a bona fide guitar hero for the '90s, putting the lie to the hard canard that only speedburner metal mega-hair dudes can make the front covers of the guitar mags.\n\n1\t\tFunky Mama\tPatton\t5:41\n2\t\tElmira St. Boogie\tGatton\t4:03\n3\t\tBlues Newburg\tGatton\t4:10\n4\t\tQuiet Village\tBaxter\t4:49\n5\t\tRed Label\tBattistone, Gatton\t5:05\n6\t\tIn My Room\tUsher, Wilson\t4:53\n7\t\tThe Simpsons\tEffman\t3:17\n8\t\tMuthaship\tGatton, Windsor, Windsor\t4:39\n9\t\tPretty Blue\tGatton\t6:07\n10\t\tFandingus\tGatton\t3:06\n11\t\tSlidin' Home\tGatton\t4:54\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/88-elmira-st-r8035&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/88-elmira-st-r8035&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d1c53894ec2758c06ad1b314b9d472274925e60","amp;dn":"Danny.Gatton.-.88.Elmira.St.FLAC-Mighty","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d1c53894ec2758c06ad1b314b9d472274925e60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,28,83,137,78,194,117,140,6,173,27,49,75,157,71,34,116,146,94,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
