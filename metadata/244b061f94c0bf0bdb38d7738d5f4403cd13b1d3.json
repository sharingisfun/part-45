Benn is a passionate, articulate speaker and \nobviously enjoys himself debunking &quot;myths&quot;, such as the \nsuggestion that an elected parliament is the same as a \ndemocracy. And it will come as no surprise to hear that he \nhas controversial views on subjects such as immigration. \nBut the programme is seriously marred by its visuals: at \nbest they distract attention from Benn's erudite words, but \noccasionally they're downright bizarre.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nVideo:\n======\nCodec: XviD MPEG-4\nFrame Rate: 25fps\nAspect Ratio: 16:9 (1.778)\nFrame Size: 512x288\nDatarate: 1295kbps\n\nAudio:\n======\nCodec: MP3\nData rate: 128k CBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:244b061f94c0bf0bdb38d7738d5f4403cd13b1d3","amp;dn":"Big+Ideas+That+Changed+the+World+-+Tony+Benn+on+Democracy+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"244b061f94c0bf0bdb38d7738d5f4403cd13b1d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,75,6,31,148,192,191,11,219,56,215,115,141,95,68,3,205,19,177,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
