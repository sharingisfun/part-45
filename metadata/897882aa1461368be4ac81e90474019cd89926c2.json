However this is not very Handy. Creating playlists take time and come along the month. This month I had a little catching up to do so that did not fit to nicely. So the first eight playlists of November may contain some outdated tracks (but sound awfully well).\n\nTo make it easier I decided to release the lists one by one. The parts have a continuous number to check completeness. @1 in front of the playlist title still means Easy listening, @2 Rocky and @3 Alternative.\n\n\nDutch Treat - Indie Playlist 1111-04 - @3 Teardrop\n\n01 - Calling Out Your Name (The Epstein) \n02 - Getting Away With It (Electronic) \n03 - Enjoy The Silence (Depeche Mode) \n04 - Heavyweight Champion Of The World (Reverend &amp; The Makers) \n05 - April, Let's Send His Colleagues An Email (The Phonemes) \n06 - Mr. Bassman (Sondre Lerche) \n07 - The Bee Song (Plight Of The Bumblebee) (Maria In The Shower) \n08 - Daniel (Bat For Lashes) \n09 - Black Cat (Cross Record) \n10 - Karma Police (Radiohead) \n11 - Teardrop (Massive Attack) \n12 - Scooby Snacks (Fun Lovin' Criminals) \n13 - Stars (Dubstar) \n14 - Suedehead (Morrissey) \n15 - The Universal (Blur) \n16 - Audacity Of Huge (Simian Mobile Disco) \n17 - Thunder Love (Little Dragon) \n18 - In Particular (Blonde Redhead) \n19 - Shake Me Down (Cage The Elephant) \n20 - Blue Flower, Blue Flame (Destroyer) \n21 - Come Back To What You Know (Embrace) \n22 - Three Sisters (J.
