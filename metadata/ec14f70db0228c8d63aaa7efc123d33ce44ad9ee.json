The film focuses on the life of many animals. It is narrated by Sotigui KouyatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©.\nThe film credits also list the natural events, animals and their situations as part of the &quot;cast list.&quot;\n\n\nJust like the director did some ago in Microcosmos, this is a project in which we can see the advances of film-making, the one that can show us images that we had never seen before.\nFrom the crystallization of Vitamin C through and electronic microscope, to the sea horses love dance, from the amazing life of the walking fish to the love parakeets, from the beautiful dance of Jellyfish to the lava rivers, every single image is filled with color, life, joy and some kind of mystery.\nBlending humor with seriousness innocence with wisdom an African griot uses the evocative language of myth and fable to relate the birth of the universe and the stars the fiery beginnings of our planet and the appearance of life on earth featuring animals as the main players.\nGenesis is one of the most fascinating and relevant documentaries. It is an account of the beginning of everything, but focuses most especially on the nature of life on our planet.\nThe truths contained in this film and the fashion in which they are masterfully woven into a much broader, overall picture are compelling, the imagery is mesmerizing, and for anyone who is truly interested in the essence and mannerisms of life as we know it, this film is an excellent introduction to a fuller, more complete understanding.\n\nThis is an ISO image file, so you can do what you like with it - burn to DVD, play on computer with VLC (or similar). \n\n\nRunning time : 77 minutes\n\nFormat : PAL (720 x 576) Region free\nAspect Ratio : 16 : 9\n\nVideo : Mpeg 1/2\nAudio : AC3 (5.1 and 2 ch) french\nSubs : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec14f70db0228c8d63aaa7efc123d33ce44ad9ee","amp;dn":"Genesis+-+2004+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec14f70db0228c8d63aaa7efc123d33ce44ad9ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,20,247,13,176,34,140,141,99,170,167,239,193,35,211,60,228,74,217,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
