The black on black sleeve and album title, as well as some of the track titles, point toward a darker mood, but it's not as if the first three Field albums are all sunshine rays -- far from it -- and it's not as if Cupid's Head is dominated by unrelenting bleakness. This offers another slight change from Willner's past -- enough to maintain perked attention from listeners in love with his sound, while those who are less enamored won't hear enough that distinguishes it from any other Field album. Regardless, the sound is very familiar; no longer novel. Willner's still capable of creating grade-A material, like the baleful &quot;They Won't See Me&quot; and the dazzling &quot;Black Sea&quot;; the manner in which the rushing and near-euphoric latter changes course around the seven-minute mark is akin to a brilliantly sequenced and mixed DJ set. Other tracks, such as the staid &quot;A Guided Tour&quot; and washed-out &quot;20 Seconds of Affection,&quot; lack vitality, like they were made before Willner felt driven to make an album with as much imagination as his first three.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fc867d34c86f99d739419b1f928cd44742a0290","amp;dn":"The+Field+-+Cupid%27s+Head+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fc867d34c86f99d739419b1f928cd44742a0290","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,200,103,211,76,134,249,157,115,148,25,177,249,40,205,68,116,42,2,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
