Even when they ornament-- and the music is so harmonically and rhythmically simple that it's almost all ornament-- it's more amble than flash; on the closing &quot;Solo Virtuose&quot;, Papa Diabate has about seventeen minutes all to himself, so he spreads out, sometimes lapsing into arpeggios alongside brother Sekou for the sake of mutual hypnosis.\n\nMuch of Syliphone's dance material has a Latin inflection, and even though the Diabates are distinct in their more lyric, acoustic sound, they offer fusions like &quot;Dembati Galant&quot;, which features kora-- an African harp-- spilling out over ecstatic flamenco whirls. I'm not sure what kind of imperialistic impressions were at work here, but the notes suggest a popularity of Cuban music at the time, something I'd associate more closely with Congo and the DRC, where musicians formed their own take on rumba. Whatever and whyever it is, it's probably best not to think about it too much, because reasonable, two-chord approximations of infinity's bliss are pretty hard to find, and they fumble toward it at least a couple times.\n\nThe Diabates were from Guinea, but everyone knows what a porch feels like. Borders aside, there's at least a few elegant, universal approaches to simple alchemy, and African Virtuoses-- a bunch of guys with acoustic guitars-- can safely count themselves as one. -Mike Powell, October 10, 2007 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/45294-the-classic-guinean-guitar-group&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/45294-the-classic-guinean-guitar-group&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Classic-Guinean-Guitar-Group/dp/B000S0KXM2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Classic-Guinean-Guitar-Group/dp/B000S0KXM2/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracks\n1- Nanibali\n2- Kankan Diarabi\n3- Wouloukoro\n4- Hafia\n5- Dembati Galant\n6- Madama Nana\n7- Toubaka\n8- N'fa\n9- Ballade Sur La Lagune\n10- Solo Virtuose\n\nArtwork (300dpi scan), EAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nTools used -\nExact Audio Copy 0.99 prebeta 3\nFLAC frontend 1.7.1\nFLAC encoder/decoder 1.2.1\nreference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b40f53cbd91ff2d88aa46522a5747aff05d49046","amp;dn":"African+Virtuoses+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b40f53cbd91ff2d88aa46522a5747aff05d49046","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,15,83,203,217,31,242,216,138,164,101,34,165,116,122,255,5,212,144,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
