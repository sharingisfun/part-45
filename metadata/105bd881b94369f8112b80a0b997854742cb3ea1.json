He was always in front never followed anyone just did what he wanted and let everyone try to copy him. From the 1969 release Pretties for You to the last one Dirty Diamonds Alice was always ahead of his time. The bands who tried to keep up with him are endless. Bands like Kiss, Twisted Sisters and WASP over to new bands like Marily Manson, NIN and Lordi are all under heavy influence by him. With songs like Schools Out, No More mr Nice Guy, Feed My Frankenstein, Poison, 18 he really deserved his place in the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame. \n\nSince this is the complete discography its a bit hard to find any bonuses but i managed to sneak in two. The first is the 1969 live rare live release of a Toronto show called Toronto rock 'n' roll revival and the second is all the covers to every record.\n\nPretties For You\nToronto Rock 'N' Roll Revival\nEasy Action\nAlice Cooper At The Whiskey A Go Go\nKiller\nLove It To Death\nSchool's Out\nBillion Dollar Babies\nMuscle Of Love\nGreatest Hits 1974\nWelcome To My Nightmare\nAlice Cooper Goes To Hell\nLace And Whiskey\nThe Alice Cooper Show\nFrom The Inside\nFlush The Fashion\nSpecial Forces\nZipper Catches Skin\nDa Da\nConstrictor\nRaise Your Fist And Yell\nThrash\nThe Beast Of Alice Cooper 1989\nHey Stoopid!\nThe Last Temptation\nClassics\nA Fistful Of Alice\nThe Life And Crimes Of Alice Cooper 1999\nBrutal Planet\nBillion Dollar Babies (Deluxe Edition)\nThe Definitive 2001\nDragontown\nWelcome To My Nightmare (Deluxe Edition)\nThe Eyes Of Alice Cooper\nDirty Diamonds\nGood to see you again\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:105bd881b94369f8112b80a0b997854742cb3ea1","amp;dn":"Alice+Cooper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"105bd881b94369f8112b80a0b997854742cb3ea1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,91,216,129,185,67,105,248,17,43,128,160,185,151,133,71,66,203,62,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
