With winter looming large, the country's train, station and engineering staff are entering their toughest season. When overhead power lines are ripped down by a freight train, it spells chaos. Yet even without engineering problems, this is a network under constant strain, particularly at Edinburgh's Waverly station. Yet what really makes Scotland stand-out from the rest of the UK are its vast and remote wilderness railways, such as the West Highland Line. Here, rail engineer Iain MacKinnon spends his days inspecting miles of mountain track on foot, clearing dead stags from the line and tightening every loose bolt that he finds.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1580 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 404\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\nNumber Of Parts: 6\nPart Size: average 681 MB\nEncoded by Harry65\nSource: PDTV\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01qsk0j&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01qsk0j&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3579266b1cf9500c2c0d4912302751e38dd41ad2","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Railway+Keeping+Britain+on+Track+6of6+North+of+the+Borde","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3579266b1cf9500c2c0d4912302751e38dd41ad2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,121,38,107,28,249,80,12,44,13,73,18,48,39,81,227,141,212,26,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
