Circulation peaked at 187,000 in 2006 but by 2010 had dropped back to 145,000 in print, though digital subscriptions had risen to over 15,000.[5] Print ad pages declined by 5% from 2009 to 2010, while digital advertising rose 32.8% from 2009Ã¢â‚¬â€œ10.[6] Advertising accounts for 10% of total revenue for the magazine, while circulation totals 60%.[5] The Nation has lost money in all but three or four years of operation and is sustained in part by a group of more than 30,000 donors called Nation Associates, who donate funds to the periodical above and beyond their annual subscription fees. This program accounts for 30% of the total revenue for the magazine. An annual cruise also generates $200,000 for the magazine.[5] Since late 2012, the Nation Associates program has been called Nation Builders.[7]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d98a36f338059acd27360ec4fd6309874476244","amp;dn":"The+Nation++4th+August+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d98a36f338059acd27360ec4fd6309874476244","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,152,163,111,51,128,89,172,210,115,96,236,79,214,48,152,116,71,98,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
