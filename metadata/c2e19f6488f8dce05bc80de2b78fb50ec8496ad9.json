Walker covers the entirety of naked-eye physics by exploring problems of the everyday world. He focuses on the flight of Frisbees, sounds of thunder, rainbows, sand dunes, soap bubbles, etc., and uses such familiar objects as rubber bands, eggs, tea pots, and Coke bottles. Many references to outside sources guide the way through the problems. Now the inclusion of answers provides immediate feedback, making this an extraordinary approach in applying all of physics to problems of the real world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2e19f6488f8dce05bc80de2b78fb50ec8496ad9","amp;dn":"The+Flying+Circus+of+Physics+With+Answers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2e19f6488f8dce05bc80de2b78fb50ec8496ad9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,225,159,100,136,248,220,224,91,200,13,226,183,143,181,14,200,73,106,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
