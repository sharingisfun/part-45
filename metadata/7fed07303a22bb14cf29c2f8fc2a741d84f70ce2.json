But what were ancient battles really like? What weapons, tactics, armor, training, and logistics were used? And what were the crucial factors that could turn the tide of battle, giving one side victory and consigning the other to slaughter, capture, or, at best, escape to fight another day?\n\nA professor of classics and history at The Pennsylvania State University and the teacher of our immensely popular course, The History of Ancient Rome, Dr. Garrett G. Fagan has devoted extensive study to ancient warfare. In these 24 lectures he takes you into the thick of combat in some of the most notable battles fought in the Mediterranean region from prehistoric times to the 4th century A.D.\n\nEnjoy!!!\n\n/Elijah","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fed07303a22bb14cf29c2f8fc2a741d84f70ce2","amp;dn":"Great+Battles+of+the+Ancient+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fed07303a22bb14cf29c2f8fc2a741d84f70ce2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,237,7,48,58,34,187,20,207,41,194,248,252,42,116,29,132,247,12,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
