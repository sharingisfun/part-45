We live in a globalised world, and our tastes in food have widened dramatically in recent years. The Dictionary of Food reflects this huge cultural shift. With concise descriptions of dishes, ingredients, equipment, and techniques, it brings the world's cuisines, familiar and less familiar, within our grasp. '...so interesting that it only stayed on my desk very briefly before it was taken away...invaluable in anyone's kitchen and particularly useful for professional chefs.' - Caroline Waldegrave, Leiths School of Food and Wine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1227b6b47fa877f2de59e543a6395e404eb465c6","amp;dn":"Dictionary+of+Food+-+2nd+Ed+%282005%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1227b6b47fa877f2de59e543a6395e404eb465c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,39,182,180,127,168,119,242,222,89,229,67,166,57,94,64,78,180,101,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
