This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Art of War is a Chinese military treatise written during the 6th century BC by Sun Tzu. Composed of 13 chapters, each of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare, it has long been praised as the definitive work on military strategies and tactics of its time. The Art of War is one of the oldest and most famous studies of strategy and has had a huge influence on both military planning and beyond. The Art of War has also been applied, with much success, to business and managerial strategies.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n(summary from Wikipedia)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd0e1b05617af3e66c1c94ece9e2cf05b4e6dbec","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+-+Art+of+War+by+Sun+Tzu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd0e1b05617af3e66c1c94ece9e2cf05b4e6dbec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,14,27,5,97,122,243,230,108,28,148,236,233,226,207,5,180,230,219,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
