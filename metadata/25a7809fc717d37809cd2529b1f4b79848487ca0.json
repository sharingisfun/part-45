Klune \nRead by Sean Crisden \nFormat: M4B \nBitrate: 96 Kbps \nUnabridged\n\nThree years ago, Bear McKennaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother took off for parts unknown with her new boyfriend, leaving Bear to raise his six-year-old brother Tyson, aka the Kid. Somehow theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve muddled through, but since heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s totally devoted to the Kid, Bear isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t actually doing much livingÃ¢â‚¬â€with a few exceptions, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s retreated from the world, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mostly okay with that. Until Otter comes home.\n\nOtter is BearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s older brother, and as theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done for their whole lives, Bear and Otter crash and collide in ways neither expect. This time, though, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nowhere to run from the depth of emotion between them. Bear still believes his place is as the KidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guardian, but he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help thinking there could be something more for him in the world... something or someone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25a7809fc717d37809cd2529b1f4b79848487ca0","amp;dn":"Bear%2C+Otter+and+the+Kid+by+T.J.+Klune","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25a7809fc717d37809cd2529b1f4b79848487ca0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,167,128,159,199,23,211,120,9,205,37,41,177,244,183,152,72,72,124,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
