Just ask Zoey Redbird ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s become an expert on suckiness. In one week she has gone from having three boyfriends to having none, and from having a close group of friends who trusted and supported her, to being an outcast. Speaking of friends, the only two Zoey has left are undead and unMarked. And Neferet has declared war on humans, which Zoey knows in her heart is wrong. But will anyone listen to her?
