Here, six years after Aerial and just six months after DirectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Cut comes 50 Words for Snow. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s BushÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s third album since 2005, which technically puts her up on The Strokes, The Shins or Modest Mouse.\n\nAnd jolly spectacular it is too, which is never a guarantee: Aerial was a masterpiece; The Red Shoes, The Sensual World and the diversionary DirectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Cut werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t. Bush has always been best at her most focussed, and here she delves monomaniacally into snow and the winter ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ its mythology, its romance, its darkness, its rhythmic frenzy and glacial creep. 50 Words for Snow is artic and hoare frost and robin red breast, sleepy snowscapes and death on the mountain, drifts in the Home Counties and gales through Alaska.\n\nBut it is mostly, I think, a record about how the fleeting elusiveness of snow mirrors that of love; and if IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m off the mark there, then certainly as a work of music one can view it as a sort of frozen negative to AerialÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A Sky of Honey, the transcendent 42 minute suite about a summerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s day that took up the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s second half. Whatever the case, 50 Words...demands to be listened to as a whole: the days of Bush as a singles-orientated artist are long gone on a long, sometimes difficult record on which the shortest track clocks in at a shade under seven minutes.\n\nThe first three songs clock in at over half an hour and comprise the starkest, most difficult and in some ways most beautiful passage of music in BushÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career. Based on minimal, faltering piano and great yawning chasms of silence, these tracks mirror the eerie calm of soft, implacable snowfall and winter\\'s dark. On the opening ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“SnowflakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ she shares vocal duties with her young son Albert, whose pure falsetto blends into her lower register. Vaguely suggestive of carol singing, his tones are also clear and elemental, without the shackles of adult emotion as he keens ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI am ice and dust and light. I am sky and here.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ over his motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spare, hard keys. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Lake TahoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is the real challenge here: a crawling ghost story about a drowned woman, gilded with cold choral washes, its diamond keys crystallize into being a note at a time. Its 11 minutes are roughly as far away from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“BabooshkaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ as itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s possible to get. Yet as Steve GaddÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s soft, jazzy drums gather in pace and intricacy, life and movement enters this crepsular musical tundra, the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s low key opening sequence swelling to a soft crescendo with final part ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“MistyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. A bleakly sensual love story that, er, appears to be about a doomed affair with a snowman, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s somewhat reminiscent of Spirit of Eden-era Talk Talk as its 13-minute expanse periodically blooms into gorgeously tangled blossoms of bucolic guitar.\n\nSingle ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Wild ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sees a shift in gear ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ springy, exotic electronics, a sprightlier pace and a sense of playfulness as a husky-voiced Bush trades the last songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s impossible man for another as she dreams about the possibility of a yeti. Describing a Kate Bush track without making it sound silly can be rather trying ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ this is a woman whose past triumphs include several songs featuring Rolf Harris ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but I guess ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Wild ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ works as lush, sensual dream of the possibility of the things that might existing outside humdrum human experience. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not just about the yeti, but the impossibly exotic place names she mutters in her verbal quest for the creature ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKangchenjungaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Metoh-KangmiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Lhakpa-LaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Dipu MarakÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ DarjeelingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ TengbocheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ QinghaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Himachal PradeshÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and the vertiginously thrilling change of gear as heavily distorted guest Andy Fairweather Low roars a near indecipherable chorus. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also about BushÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s formidable production skills, her precise, nagging synths and total mastery of studio as instrument. \n\nThose synths imbue ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Snowed in at Wheeler StreetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ with a sense of frazzled foreboding that negates the potential cheesiness of Elton JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s throaty turn on a duet that casts him and Bush as a pair of lovers spread across time, doomed to separate at key points in history, wishing that could return to one mundane, snow bound day spent together. And a bed of electronics whip up a quietly hypnotic tumult on the astonishing title song. Here ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and again Kate Bush songs can be a job to not make sound ridiculous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bush counts to 50 in a hushed monotone as Stephen Fry (oh yes) recites a list of names for snow, real and imagined: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œblackbird brailleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ stella tundraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ vanilla swarmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ avalancheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, occasionally punctured by an eerily muted chorus in which Bush frenzied urges him to continue the list. On the one hand, it continues ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Wild ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s revelry in the intoxicating power of human language. On the other, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s least human track, its churning, chiming electronics and alien words mirroring the quiet chaos and leaden intensity of a snowstorm, its final minutes a headlong descent into oblivion and whiteout. It is astonishing, immense, bizarre and perfectly realized: only Kate Bush could conceive of this song, and nobody else will make anything like it again.\n\nAs the cooing over DirectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Cut demonstrated, even Bush on diversionary form is enough to tease gushy spurts of adjectives from the soberest of souls; hitting a true peak again, there is the temptation to drone on about how important she is, how she dwarfs most of her peers artistically, let alone the braying yahs and rahs of today who cite her as an influence. But letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s keep it in perspective: in the 26 years since Hounds of Love, Aerial and 50 Words for Snow have been her only truly fully realised albums. Kate Bush is more than fallible; but at peak she is incomparable. 9/10\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc1ab57d606df6d752a45bc8ff12bbdb42927669","amp;dn":"Kate+Bush+-+50+Words+For+Snow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc1ab57d606df6d752a45bc8ff12bbdb42927669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,26,181,125,96,109,246,215,82,164,91,200,255,18,187,219,66,146,118,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
