We are lucky to have this. \n\nenjoy! \n\n***CONTRAST CLAUSE: \nthis torrent should be considered an upgrade to the previous torrents seeded here (listed below), \nas this is a known gen. DAT copy, whereas those derive from a trade CDR of unknown generation. \n\n\nRecent version:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=278666&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=278666&lt;/a&gt; \n\nSound improved version: http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=230194 \n\nOther than fixing the pitch as best i could (matching to the official release), i have left the sound raw and intact from the original dub. \nI think some eq'ing or other &quot;technical tricks&quot; might bring out a wider spectrum of sound. I'll leave that to someone else. \n\n---------------- \n&quot;master &quot;\n\n01 Annc Intro (0:58) \n02 Naima (20:26) \n03 MFT (59:47) \n04 Leo (44:55) \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe SOUND IMPROVED version: http://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=230194 \nWas uploaded by myself  the first months of 2009 \n\ncdr in trade (from bad tape)&gt; Audacity (removed as much noise as possible and some \nvolume adjustment &gt; CD Wave [tracking &gt; FLAC\nSound Quality very variable from track to track \n\nMFT and  LEO weren't complete but there was LEO's Finale !!!\n\nbelow what I used of leo :\n\n\n09 - Leo - Saxes Reprise 06:31\n10 - Leo - Finale 01:10\n11 - Leo - Reprise (inc 2:42 + 0:18) 03:00 \n\nWhat I called Reprise is just the beginning of the 'Master' version of Leo plus in the very end the last notes \nof Leo finale missing from the 'master' tape\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nSOME HISTORY \n\n______________________\n\n\nFirst of all I divided the tracks of the &quot;MASTER&quot; following MORE OR LESS  the sequence of Solos\n\nfirst surprise : in Leo we have the following sequence :\n\n Theme\n Drums solo (with leo theme)\n Piano solo\n Drums solo\n Piano solo (truncated)\n\n a very original sequence to be true !! \n\nIn Fact after careful listening I discovered that 2 of the solos  were clones of the other 2 (with different lenghts)\nand the 2 good ones were not in sequence one after the other!!\n\nI Wonder what happened to this tape !!\nWhat is missing from this 'Master Tape'\tluckily is present in my &quot;sound improved&quot; version of this concert\nof last year \n\nSo I had to cut some 11 minutes to obtain a version of Leo Complete and without repetitions \n\n\nsecond surprise : in Leo we have the same finale as MFT !!! (I mean the last few seconds)\nthis comes from the 'SOUND IMPROVED' tape  which contained a really puzzle-version of MFT \nthat was 2/3 MFT 1/3 Leo and for a few seconds  again MFT \n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nN O T E S    to Tracks\n\n02) NAIMA \t\t20:30  \nI really recommend it - wonderful music\n \ncontains a 6'35  solo by Sanders  from 6'50 to 13'25\nreally the best I've heard from him(I'm not a fan of Sanders though ) -\nthe differences in timings (from 20:26 to 20:12 is due to noises cut off) \nnow the time is back to 20:30 due to time speed correction  \nsound quality is B /B-     A MUST \nSpeed Correction : -1.5 % (= -26cts)\n \n\n\n\n********  M F T   ********\n\n\n03) GARRISON SOLO\t\t16:04\nI worked on it for at least 40 hours (in some places i worked an hour to clean 20 seconds)\nThat's the reason why the length passed from 17:49 to 16:04 !!\nSound quality now is B-  Highly recommendable now !! (imho)\nNo speed correction done\n\n04) Trane Solo\t\t\t09:52\nA really powerful solo containing quotations from Kush (by Dizzy) and India \nThe tape was pretty bad and in 3 or 4 points i Couldn't eliminate tape twists without eliminate \nmusic\nSound quality now is B-  -   listenable (imho)\nSpeed correction : +2 % (= +35cts)\n\n\n05) Sanders Solo\t\t10:04\nA good solo \nSound quality now is C+  -   listenable (imho)\nSpeed correction : +1 % (= +18cts)\n\n06) Piano solo \t\t\t06:23\nI managed to improve it but the sound is  poor (warbles)\nSound quality now is C-  -  i'd leave it out of a cd - for completists\nSpeed correction : variable pitch adjustment  (+ 3%)\n\n16a) it's a shortened version of the solo just to join well track 5 with track 7\n\n07)   MFT - Trane finale\t13:39\nReally grand \nSound quality just a bit under the quality of  the trane solo beginning    \nSpeed correction : variable pitch adjustment (+ 4%)\n\n\nEND OF MY FAVORITE THINGS \n\n\n********   L E O   ********\n\n\n08) LEO - THEME \t\t10:31\nAfter the statement of the theme The Caos Begins\nThe first 2'40 are the same as the &quot;Leo Reprise&quot; of the SOUND IMPROVED  version \nSound Quality B-/ C+\nSpeed correction : -3 %  \n\n09) - Leo - Drums solo with Leo theme \t13.18\nVery long Drum solo\nSound quality now is C   \nSpeed correction : -3 %  \n\n\n10) - Leo - Piano solo\t\t\t10:40\nI managed to improve it but the sound is really  poor (many warbles)\nSound quality now is C--  -  i'd leave it out of a cd - for completists\nSpeed correction : -3 %  \n\n20a) it's a shortened version of the solo just to join well track 9 with track 11\n\n11) Saxes Reprise Finale\t\t07:49\nA powerful ending for Leo with the 2 saxes together\nSound quality now is B-/ c+   -  listenable (imho)\nSpeed correction : variable pitch adjustment\n\n12) Leo reprise\t\t\t\t03.09\nWhat I have entitled as &quot;Leo reprise&quot; is a track containing the Beginning of Leo \nwith the theme of leo lasting 2'42 plus a very brief ending with applause.\nSound quality now is B-- -  pretty listenable (imho)\nSpeed correction : -3 % \n\nI have left it even though we already have it as track 08  because this is all we had in the &quot;SOUND IMPROVED&quot; version\nof the beginning of the track and to me it sounded also as a good &quot;encore&quot; \n and this is the way I suggest everybody to burn the second CD \nwith this second statement of the Theme as an encore .\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bde98a3bc9f47dbf921b03f6b4c090f1a63c57d5","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane%2C+KobeJapan%2C+July+17%2C+1966","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bde98a3bc9f47dbf921b03f6b4c090f1a63c57d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,233,138,59,201,244,125,191,146,27,3,246,180,192,144,241,166,60,87,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
