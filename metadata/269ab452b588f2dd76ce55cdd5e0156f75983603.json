I know that sounds dull, but this movie is satirical, funny, shocking and just plain well done. There&amp;#039;s a healthy dollop of South Park in it, like a slug of whiskey in your coffee. It moves very fast, and the dialogue just crackles. It is anything but pretentious. :)\n\nBlue/Orange was adapted from an award-winning play written by Joe Penhall. \nThe film stars Brian Cox, John Simm and Shaun Parkes. It aired in the UK on February 23, 2005.\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/cinema/features/blue-orange.shtml&quot;&gt;Film overview at bbc.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nVIDEO CODEC: Xvid\nRESOLUTION: 672 x 384\nFRAME RATE: 25 FPS\nAUDIO CODEC: mpga\nCHANNELS: 2\nSAMPLE RATE: 48000 Hz\nBITRATE: 115 kb/s\nDURATION: 1:27:02\nFILE SIZE: 700 MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:269ab452b588f2dd76ce55cdd5e0156f75983603","amp;dn":"Blue%2FOrange+%282005%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"269ab452b588f2dd76ce55cdd5e0156f75983603","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,154,180,82,181,136,242,221,118,206,85,205,213,224,21,111,117,152,54,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
