The author, a close relative of HergÃƒÂ©, appreciated the excessive and the astonishing that could be found within the scope of scientific invention; his heroes, very much ahead of their time, discover extraordinary objects and phenomena through their uncommon adventures. Before devoting himself exclusively to them, Edgar Pierre Jacobs collaborated with HergÃƒÂ© and took part in the realization of &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, &quot;King Ottokar's Sceptre&quot;, &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;, and the &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;.\n\nThese books were originally released in a different order by Les Editions du Lombard.\n\nBlake &amp; Mortimer 06 - S.O.S. Meteors\nAuthor:  Edgar P. Jacobs\nOriginally published:  1959\nPublication Date:  September 2009\nExtreme weather threatens the whole of continental Europe, turning the lives of its citizens inside out. The French government calls Professor Mortimer to help solve this enigma. Mortimer travels near Paris to visit his friend Professor Labrousse, the chief French meteorologist. But when the taxi driver Labrousse sent to meet Mortimer at the station disappears, our friend becomes the prime suspect. Mortimer gets in touch with his old friend Blake, also in France, to help him out of this tricky situation.\nHowever, Blake disappears as well, so Mortimer and Labrousse have two missing-person cases to investigate. They soon discover that the two disappearances are not only linked to each other, but also to the climatic catastrophes.\n\nBlake &amp; Mortimer 09 - The Sarcophagi of the Sixth Continent Pt 1\nAuthors: Yves Sente &amp; AndrÃƒÂ© Juillard\nOriginally published:  2003\nPublication Date:  January 2011\nPhilip Mortimer spent his youth in the land of the Maharajas. He loves India, but his last visit there did not end well. Now, many years later, the famous Professor Mortimer is in charge of the British pavilion at the Brussels Universal Exposition.
