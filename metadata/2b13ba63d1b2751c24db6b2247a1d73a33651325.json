The band underwent multiple line-up changes throughout its existence, with frontman Roger McGuinn (aka Jim McGuinn) remaining the sole consistent member until the group disbanded in 1973. Although they only managed to attain the huge commercial success of contemporaries like The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and The Rolling Stones for a short period of time (1965ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“66), The Byrds are today considered by critics to be one of the most influential bands of the 1960s. Initially, they pioneered the musical genre of folk rock, melding the influence of The Beatles and otherInvasion bands with contemporary and traditional folk music. As the 1960s progressed, the band were also influential in originating psychedelic rock, raga rock, and country rock. In addition, the band's signature blend of clear harmony singing and McGuinn's jangly twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar has continued to be influential on popular music up to the present day. Among the band's most enduring songs are their cover versions of Bob Dylan's &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; and Pete Seeger's &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn! (to Everything There is a Season)&quot;, along with the self-penned originals, &quot;I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better&quot;, &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;, &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star&quot;, &quot;Ballad of Easy Rider&quot; and &quot;Chestnut Mare&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Byrds&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Byrds&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Byrds - Definitive Collection\nThis compilation 1995\n\n01  The Byrds - Mr. Tambourine Man\n02  The Byrds - Chimes Of Freedom\n03  The Byrds - The Bells Of Rhymney\n04  The Byrds - I'll Feel A Whole Lot Better\n05  The Byrds - All I Really Want To Do\n06  The Byrds - Turn!
