Sydney Poitier is famously tone deaf lol.  He's currently Ambassador of the Bahamas to Japan.\n\nGreat music, really like it.  I found this in my travels, didn't even know it existed, very hard to find.  This is the &quot;2012 edition&quot;,  FLAC files, Monophonic.  I couldn't find any uploads of the stereo version, there was a stereo album made.  I've include pics of a stereo album with all the track titles, also a movie poster and a bunch of info pages for good measure.\n\nCredit goes to the original ripper. Enjoy, and remember to seed!
