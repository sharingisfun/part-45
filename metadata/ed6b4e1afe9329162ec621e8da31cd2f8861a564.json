Released on October 28, 1997, the experimental rock album consists of four Compact Discs. Each of its eight songs consists of four stereo tracks, one from each CD. The album was designed so that when played simultaneously on four separate audio systems, the four CDs would produce a harmonic or juxtaposed sound. The discs can also be played in different combinations, omitting one, two or three discs. The album's title is a portmanteau of two words: Zaire, chosen as a symbol of anarchy after Wayne Coyne heard a radio news story about the political instability of the African nation, and eureka (literally: &quot;I have found it&quot;), an expression of joyous discovery.[1]\n\nZaireeka was the first album made by the band since the departure of guitarist Ronald Jones.[2] It acted as a preview of the music and style that would surface on the next album, The Soft Bulletin (1999)[3] and is the predecessor to the band's more conventional surround sound releases.\n\nNo. \tTitle                                                   \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Okay I'll Admit That I Really Don't Understand&quot;   \t        2:51\n2. \t&quot;Riding to Work in the Year 2025 (Your Invisible Now)&quot;   \t7:03\n3. \t&quot;Thirty-Five Thousand Feet of Despair&quot;   \t                4:59\n4. \t&quot;A Machine in India&quot;   \t                                        10:23\n5. \t&quot;The Train Runs Over the Camel But Is Derailed by the Gnat&quot;   \t6:14\n6. \t&quot;How Will We Know?
