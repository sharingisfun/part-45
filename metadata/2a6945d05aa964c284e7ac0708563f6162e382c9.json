Whether you own a window box or a meadow, every outdoor space can yield a fine crop of fruit or vegetables. Plant some delicious cut-and-come again salads in a window box, plan a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsquare footÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ garden on a four-foot square plot, or use your flowerbed to grow decorative vegetables and flowers together. Growing your own food doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to be time-consuming or expensive. A few packets of seeds and some basic tools Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a spade, fork, hoe, rake, trowel and watering can Ã¢â‚¬â€œ will provide you with all you need to fill a plot with vegetables. Whatever you choose to grow youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find nothing beats the satisfaction of serving up a home-cooked, home-grown meal to family or friends. Good luck and happy digging.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a6945d05aa964c284e7ac0708563f6162e382c9","amp;dn":"Grow+your+own+food","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a6945d05aa964c284e7ac0708563f6162e382c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,105,69,208,90,169,100,194,132,231,172,7,8,86,63,97,98,227,130,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
