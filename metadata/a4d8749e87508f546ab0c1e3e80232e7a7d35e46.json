(add your local language in the settings, if it's not there by default).\n\nPsychic word completions and predictions are generated by A.I.typeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s servers on the Cloud. When the device is offline or Internet connection is too slow, or if you disabled Cloud-based prediction, word suggestions will be generated by the device only.\n\nThe keyboard also learns your unique words and style of writing (MyType). Just type your texts normally and it will keep learning. The learning model is stored on the device itself and is NOT shared with our servers.\n\nPrivacy notice: while installing A.I.type Keyboard, you will receive a warning message about collecting sensitive data. This is the standard general-purpose Android message issued for any downloaded keyboard and it does not pertain to A.I.type. Our keyboard DOES NOT COLLECT YOUR SENSITIVE DATA.\n\nPersonal request: if you like our keyboard - please be kind and give us 5 stars in the Market (Ã¢â‚¬Å“four is more but five Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and we thrive!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½), plus a nice comment.
