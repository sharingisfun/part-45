But they are also opposites, with gravely different futures ahead. It is the 1960s, and UdayanÃ¢â‚¬â€charismatic and impulsiveÃ¢â‚¬â€finds himself drawn to the Naxalite movement, a rebellion waged to eradicate inequity and poverty; he will give everything, risk all, for what he believes. Subhash, the dutiful son, does not share his brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political passion; he leaves home to pursue a life of scientific research in a quiet, coastal corner of America. \n\nBut when Subhash learns what happened to his brother in the lowland outside their familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home, he goes back to India, hoping to pick up the pieces of a shattered family, and to heal the wounds Udayan left behindÃ¢â‚¬â€including those seared in the heart of his brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife.\n\nMasterly suspenseful, sweeping, piercingly intimate, The Lowland is a work of great beauty and complex emotion; an engrossing family saga and a story steeped in history that spans generations and geographies with seamless authenticity. It is Jhumpa Lahiri at the height of her considerable powers.\n\nAudio CD\nPublisher: Random House Audio; Unabridged edition (September 24, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0739341812\nISBN-13: 978-0739341810\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
