The only authentic collection in the galaxy is located in a museum housed on old Earth. Needing a break from work, she comes to Union Station to indulge in an orgy of reading. Of course, she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t count on falling asleep in the library and missing the last flight off-planet before the winter season suspends interstellar traffic.\nJake is a sergeant in the Space Militia. He loses the draw this year and stays behind when Earth is evacuated for the winter. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his job to make sure the mutant life forms spawned by the nuke wars donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t break through the museumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s barrier. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resigned himself to a long, lonely winter fighting mutants and boredom.\nWhen he discovers heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not alone on the frigid remnants of manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home world, he knows he should be a gentleman and keep his hands to himself, but spring is a long way off and LiisaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charms are hard to resist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:075acc22a44d4a0aba35ef89bf972b858a94efe8","amp;dn":"Stranded+On+Earth+by+Anne+Kane","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"075acc22a44d4a0aba35ef89bf972b858a94efe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,90,204,34,164,77,74,10,186,53,239,137,191,151,43,133,138,148,239,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
