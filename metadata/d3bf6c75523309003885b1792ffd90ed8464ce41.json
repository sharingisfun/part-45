But as technology has advanced and our understanding of biology has deepened, the answer has evolved. For decades, scientists have been exploring the limits of nature by modifying and manipulating DNA, cells and whole organisms to create new ones that could never have existed on their own. \nIn Creation, science writer Adam Rutherford explains how we are now radically exceeding the boundaries of evolution and engineering entirely novel creaturesÃ¢â‚¬â€from goats that produce spider silk in their milk to bacteria that excrete diesel to genetic circuits that identify and destroy cancer cells. As strange as some of these creations may sound, this new, synthetic biology is helping scientists develop radical solutions to some of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most pressing crisesÃ¢â‚¬â€from food shortages to pandemic disease to climate changeÃ¢â‚¬â€and is paving the way for inventions once relegated to science fiction. \nMeanwhile, these advances are shedding new light on the biggest mystery of allÃ¢â‚¬â€how did life begin? We know that every creature on Earth came from a single cell, sparked into existence four billion years ago. And as we come closer and closer to understanding the ancient root that connects all living things, we may finally be able to achieve a second genesisÃ¢â‚¬â€the creation of new life where none existed before \nCreation takes us on a journey four billion years in the makingÃ¢â‚¬â€from the very first cell to the ground-breaking biological inventions that will shape the future of our planet.\nGenre: Non-Fiction&gt; Science&gt; Origins of Life\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3bf6c75523309003885b1792ffd90ed8464ce41","amp;dn":"Creation+-+Adam+Rutherford.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3bf6c75523309003885b1792ffd90ed8464ce41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,191,108,117,82,51,9,0,56,133,177,121,47,253,144,237,132,100,206,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
