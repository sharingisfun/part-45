Over the past decade, much progress has been made with respect to the development of vaccines, antibodies, and other therapeutic proteins. Biopharmaceuticals in Plants: Toward the Next Century of Medicine provides a comprehensive survey of all major aspects of the development and production of plant-made biopharmaceuticals.\n\nAccompanied by an exhaustive list of references to facilitate further study, this critical volume:\n\n    * Describes the theory and practice of modern plant transformation techniques with respect to nuclear and plastic genomes\n    * Outlines the steps involved in the generation of transgenic plants\n    * Discusses the engineering of plant virus expression vectors for transient expression of vaccine proteins and other therapeutics in plant tissue\n    * Addresses the significant role of glycosylation in the production of plant-made mammalian proteins\n    * Investigates the basis of mucosal immunity using plant-based oral vaccines\n    * Examines the scale-up of plant-derived vaccine and therapeutic proteins in entire crops or in large batch cell suspension cultures\n    * Explores the development of clinical trials utilizing plant-derived biopharmaceutical proteins\n    * Evaluates risks and biosafety concerns regarding plant-derived pharmaceuticals\n\nThe book concludes with a discussion of the future of plant-based vaccines and other therapeutic proteins with respect to commercial viability and as a tool to improve global public health. Far-reaching in its scope, this text is a baseline reference that students and researchers in a broad range of fields such as medicine, plant science, biotechnology, crop science, natural products chemistry, and engineering will consult regularly. It will also serve as a useful tool for individuals and companies seeking to invest in this dynamic area.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 224 pages\n# Publisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (November 10, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1439804745\n# ISBN-13: 978-1439804742","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3817b29f3d0483dcff21156fc9c4e5d36d2e3a1d","amp;dn":"Biopharmaceuticals+in+Plants%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3817b29f3d0483dcff21156fc9c4e5d36d2e3a1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,23,178,159,61,4,131,220,255,33,21,111,201,196,229,211,109,46,58,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
