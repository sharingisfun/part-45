Fistful Of Roses\n\n'The Dreaming Fields', Matraca BergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last album, was awash with wry themes such as the one in Ã¢â‚¬ËœYour HusbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cheating On Us.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Berg is a woman who finds common ground in the experiences of so many other females from all walks of life, as well as a dedication to her Tennessee roots. But she also dips intrepidly into solemn waters as the mother/narrator in Ã¢â‚¬ËœSouth of Heaven', a song about the horrors of battle. \n\nBy 22 she had already garnered a Grammy nomination and achieved a #1 hit. Now she has returned to the studio with 'LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Truck Stop'. The sensitive singer songwriter tells simple, but relatable stories with instrumentation that never overrides the message.\n\nThe first song, Ã¢â‚¬ËœLoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Truck StopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, brings out her brightest vocals. BergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s style shuffles between a cavalier Rickie Lee Jones and a winsome Trisha Yearwood. Ã¢â‚¬ËœHer Name is Mary,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“with maraschino cherry-colored hair/Has the scripture tattooed on her chest/The one that her grandma loved best,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ shows off her innate wit.\n\nYou can hear the plaintive black hills in the strum and tearful vocals of Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlack RibbonsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nThe allegorical Ã¢â‚¬ËœFoolish FlowerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ speaks to the torment endured by out-of-place souls. Ã¢â‚¬ËœWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Already GoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a tender ballad about bidding farewell: Ã¢â‚¬Å“ WinterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been hanging around too long.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe surprisingly bluesy Ã¢â‚¬ËœI Buried Your Love AliveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is understated, but a far cry from the other mostly Americana styled tracks. The austere finger picking of Ã¢â‚¬ËœMagdaleneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ accompanies a quizzical sentiment. Ã¢â‚¬ËœMy Heart Will Never Break This Way AgainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is heartbreaking, yet amazingly hopeful. \n\nThe heaving blues harp of Ã¢â‚¬ËœSad Magnolia,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ with its stunning lyrics of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wish you were mine/Underneath the moon of CarolineÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, convey a dreamy spirit, and even when Berg tackles the proverbial travelling song she stamps out a highly charged show on her mournful rendition of Ã¢â‚¬ËœWaiting on a Slow TrainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. \n\nThe closer 'Fistful of Roses' is the one piano-driven cut. With lyrics like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fistful of roses/Handful of thorns/Chiseled in stone/The day you were bornÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Berg solidifies any notion that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a natural born storyteller. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c4b56a36ad83130e8a98eb08599ca5512bdaf0c","amp;dn":"Matraca+Berg+-+Love%27s+Truck+Stop+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c4b56a36ad83130e8a98eb08599ca5512bdaf0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,75,86,163,106,216,49,48,232,169,142,176,133,153,202,85,18,189,175,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
