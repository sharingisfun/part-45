The Xbox 360 port was developed by Venom Games. The game was initially released in North America and Europe on 2006-07-11, and later was made available on Valve&amp;#039;s Steam system on 2006-11-06. Prey uses a heavily modified version of id Tech 4 to use portals and variable gravity to create the environments the player explores. The game&amp;#039;s story is focused on Cherokee Domasi Tawodi as he, his girlfriend, and grandfather are abducted aboard an alien spaceship known as The Sphere as it consumes material, both inanimate and living, from the Earth in order to sustain itself. Tommy&amp;#039;s Cherokee past allows him to let his spirit roam freely at times, and gives Tommy an edge in his attempt to stop the Sphere.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a38d55b10617cf966dbcf191895b63eeb93ff7aa","amp;dn":"Prey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a38d55b10617cf966dbcf191895b63eeb93ff7aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,141,85,177,6,23,207,150,109,188,241,145,137,91,99,238,185,63,247,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
