Through-out the sceneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creation, Elias will use simple modeling tools and techniques to first block out the overall shapes, before adding subdivision and refining the objects final appearance. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll then discuss the material and texture setup, as well as lighting the scene for our final product shot. This is a great tutorial for beginner and intermediate Modo artists looking to improve their modeling, lighting and rendering skills. We know youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to love it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a1545639f655085c9d6615d6734d5c10be61bbe","amp;dn":"TutsPlus+-+Create+Soap+Scene+In+Modo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a1545639f655085c9d6615d6734d5c10be61bbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,21,69,99,159,101,80,133,201,214,97,93,103,52,213,193,11,230,27,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
