Ingeborg (Dagny Lind) is a middle-aged woman living in a small Swedish community where she supports herself giving piano lessons and running a boarding house. Ingeborg has devoted much of her life to looking after Nelly (Inga Landgre), a teenage girl who was abandoned by her mother Jenny (Marianne Lofgren) when she was a baby. Ingeborg deeply loves Nelly and think of her as her daughter, and she&amp;#039;s distraught when Jenny appears and announces she intends to reclaim Nelly and take her to Stockholm, where she now runs a successful beauty salon. Despite Ingeborg&amp;#039;s pleas that her poor health limits the time she can spend with Nelly, Jenny is adamant, and the teenager decides to go, though her decision is largely motivated by her mixed feelings about Ulf (Allan Bohlin), an older veterinarian who wants to marry her, and her sudden infatuation with Jack (Stig Olin), a mysterious charmer who is a friend and distant relative of Jenny. Kris (aka Crisis) was adapted from a popular stage play by Leck Fisher; the production was hampered by Bergman&amp;#039;s inexperience, and his mentor Victor Sjostrom was brought in to supervise the last few weeks of shooting.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Kris.(Crisis).1946.Ingmar Bergman.dvdrip.xvid.ac3-rulle.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.44 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 32mn\n      Bit rate : 2210 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 5.93 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 32mn\n      Bit rate : 2014 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.272\n      StreamSize : 1.31 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 32mn\n      Bit rate : 191 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 127 MiB\n\nSwedish audio, English and Portuguese (PT) subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5a36e5fce6d683be62310845d339e2736bc45a6","amp;dn":"Kris+-+Crisis+-+Ingmar+Bergman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5a36e5fce6d683be62310845d339e2736bc45a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,163,110,95,206,109,104,59,230,35,16,132,93,51,158,39,54,188,69,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
