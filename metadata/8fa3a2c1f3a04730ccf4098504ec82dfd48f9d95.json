In 1999, NOVA's cameras were there to capture Fash's excavation of the burial site of the legendary ancestral king and original founder of Copan's dynasty.&quot;\n\nFile: PBS.Nova.-.S28E11.-.Lost.King.of.the.Maya.mp4 (241MB, 54:02)\nResolution: 708x378 (native DVD), 16:9 aspect ratio\nAudio: AAC 48kHz 128kb/s stereo\nVideo: H-264 MPEG-4, 29.97fps\nSubtitles: English CC\nEncoding: Handbrake, RF=25\nOriginally broadcast: 2001-Feb.-13\n\nNotes:\n\n- The aspect ratio and resolution of the original DVD source were non-standard/letterboxed. I cropped out most of the letterboxing. The black bar at the bottom isn't erroneous; it is due to the program's overlays extending into the letterboxing so enough was left that they were not lost.\n\n- Wikipedia calls this episode S28E04 (all of their episode numbers seem to differ from here.)\n\n- Please seed to 100% or higher and do your part so free media will always be available. My upstream isn't the fastest (max. about 50kBps) so be patient and you'll get your file.\nIf everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fa3a2c1f3a04730ccf4098504ec82dfd48f9d95","amp;dn":"PBS+Nova+-+S28E11+-+Lost+King+of+the+Maya","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fa3a2c1f3a04730ccf4098504ec82dfd48f9d95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,163,162,193,243,160,71,48,204,244,9,133,4,236,130,223,212,143,157,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
