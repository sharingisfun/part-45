Franklin Lopez of the Vancouver Media Co-Op filed this report from the streets of Toronto.\n\n\n- Naomi Klein: The Real Crime Scene Was Inside the G20 Summit\n\nAs thousands protested in the streets of Toronto, inside the G20 summit, world leaders agreed to a controversial goal of cutting government deficits in half by 2013.
