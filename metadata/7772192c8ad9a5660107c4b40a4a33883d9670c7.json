I have read reviews before reading the books myself and what I did was to try to recognize which reviews actualy sound believable or not. For example, 1 star rating doesn't mean the book is bad if the review says &quot;I didn't like the cover&quot;. :) I also did the same analysis with 4 or 5 star reviews. Then I actualy read many of them. I have to say 75% of the books really were a very good books which added a lot of value in my life.)\n\nThis is the list:\n\nADHD:\n\n- ADHD in Adults A Psychological Guide to Practice (2006)\n- delivered_from_distraction_edward_m_hallowell_m_d_\n- Driven to Distraction - Jeremy Clarkson\n- Healing ADD - Daniel G.
