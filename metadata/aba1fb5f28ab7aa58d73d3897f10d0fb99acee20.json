From large ice sheets disintegrating and devastating losses of species to the promise that sea levels will rise more than 16 feet this century, this study shows that it is no longer a case of how much more can be Ã¢â‚¬Å“safelyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ emitted but whether emissions can be stopped completely before the EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s climate is beyond human restoration. Demonstrating that these imperatives are incompatible with politics and a &quot;business as usual&quot; attitude, this survey illustrates how the environment faces a sustainability emergency that urgently requires a clear break from failure-inducing compromise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aba1fb5f28ab7aa58d73d3897f10d0fb99acee20","amp;dn":"Climate+Code+Red+-+Spratt%2C+David+%5BNon-Fiction%5D+Mobi%2FPDF%2FEpub_%28K-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aba1fb5f28ab7aa58d73d3897f10d0fb99acee20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,161,251,95,40,171,122,165,141,115,211,137,127,16,208,251,153,172,238,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
