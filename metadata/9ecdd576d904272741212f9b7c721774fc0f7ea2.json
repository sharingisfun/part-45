What could be more terrifying?? Thrill as a rented movie is watched! Chill as a boy someone likes is called and hung up on!! Squirm as ice cream is devoured directly from the container!!!\n\nOK, maybe slumber parties are not actually that terrifying. The one featured in The Last Slumber Party, despite the presence of a scalpel toting psychopath is no exception to this rule. This is because any hint of terror that might arise from the idea of high schoolers being murdered is completely negated by the VHS video quality, amateur sound, and baffling dialogue such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d you think it was, Shelley Hack?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the last day of school, and one thing is on everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind: whether or not they are talking to Shelley Hack. In order to solve this problem, they gather at a friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house, where the oblivious parents fail to notice that the boys sneaking in and out of the house are in fact d-bags. All is good and stupid until an escaped lobotomy patient shows up and instantly becomes the most intelligent, well-mannered character in the movie.\n\nThe fashion is 80s, the soundtrack is hair metal, the poster on the wall is inexplicably of Sesame Street, and the Shelley Hack references are more abundant than every other RiffTrax weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever done combined. Slip into your footie pajamas and join Mike, Kevin, and Bill for The Last Slumber Party!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRiffTrax are comedy audio commentaries of\nHollywood\nmovies, television programs and films featuring Mystery Science Theater 3000 comedians Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett heckling (or riffing) films in the style of MST3K, a TV show in which Nelson was the head writer, and later the host. The RiffTrax are sold online and delivered by streaming video and download. The site was launched by Nelson and Legend Films, now renamed Legend3D, in 2006 and is based in San Diego. In 2012, Rifftrax was purchased from Legend3D by Mike, Kevin and Bill and the RiffTrax CEO David G. Martin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ecdd576d904272741212f9b7c721774fc0f7ea2","amp;dn":"RiffTrax+-+The+Last+Slumber+Party","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ecdd576d904272741212f9b7c721774fc0f7ea2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,205,213,118,217,4,39,39,65,33,47,155,124,114,23,116,252,15,126,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
