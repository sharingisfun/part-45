The Handbook of Alcoholic Beverages tracks the major fermentation process, and the major chemical, physical and technical processes that accompany the production of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most familiar alcoholic drinks. Indigenous beverages and small-scale production are alsocovered to asignificant extent.\n\nThe overall approach is multidisciplinary, reflecting the true nature of the subject. Thus, aspects of biochemistry, biology (including microbiology), chemistry, health science, nutrition, physics and technology are all necessarily involved, but the emphasis is on chemistry in many areas of the book. Emphasis is also on more recent developments and innovations, but there is sufficient background for less experienced readers. The approach is unified, in that although different beverages are dealt with in different chapters, there is extensive cross-referencing and comparison between the subjects of each chapter.\n\nDivided into five parts, this comprehensive two-volume work presents:\n\n    * INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND AND HISTORY: A simple introduction to the history and development of alcohol and some recent trends and developments,\n    *\n\n      FERMENTED BEVERAGES: BEERS, CIDERS, WINES AND RELATED DRINKS: the latest innovations and aspects of the different fermentation processes used in beer, wine, cider, liquer wines, fruit wines, low-alcohol and related beverages.\n    * SPIRITS: cover distillation methods and stills used in the production of whisky, cereal- and cane-based spirits, brandy, fruit spirits and liquers\n    * ANALYTICAL METHODS: covering the monitoring of processes in the production of alcoholic beverages, as well as sample preparation, chromatographic, spectroscopic, electrochemical, physical, sensory and organoleptic methods of analysis.\n    *\n\n      NUTRITION AND HEALTH ASPECTS RELATING TO ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES: includes a discussion on nutritional aspects, both macro- and micro-nutrients, of alcoholic beverages, their ingestion, absorption and catabolism, the health consequences of alcohol, and details of the additives and residues within the various beverages and their raw materials.\n\nAppropriate for food professionals working in the development and manufacture of alcohol-based drinks, as well as academic and industrial researchers involved in the development of testing methods for the analysis and regulation of alcohol in the drinks industry.\nAbout the Author\nAlan J Buglass graduated with BSc from the Chemistry Department of the University of Nottingham in 1968 and then with PhD from the Chemistry Department of the University of Essex in 1972. After a number of junior teaching and post-doctoral appointments, including one at Imperial College with Dr. B.C. Challis, he took up a teaching post at the present Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) from 1974 to 2002, where he was subsequently promoted to a senior post. At ARU, he was course leader for some chemistry courses, such as part-time Graduateship of the Royal Society of Chemistry, designed primarily for personnel in local chemical industries. Since 2002, he has been a professor at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). His present research interests are in mechanistic organosulfur chemistry and analytical organic chemistry, particularly the analysis of wine (and similar) components, both volatile and non-volatile. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (since 1995). He has published extensively including papers on analysis of wine, organic compound content of grapes in English vineyards, etc.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 1204 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley; 1 edition (March 29, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0470512024\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0470512029","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f716b0993bfcdc3bcf0cbd17e2abab120e81c3fc","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Alcoholic+Beverages%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f716b0993bfcdc3bcf0cbd17e2abab120e81c3fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,22,176,153,59,252,220,59,207,12,189,23,226,171,171,18,14,129,195,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
