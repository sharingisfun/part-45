She is neither angry nor unhappy but thinks he should be allowed to sow a few wild oats. She is convinced that he will come to his senses and return to her bosom.\n\nHe does - but not quite in the way she had imagined...\n\n\nThis feature is in Faroese language with English subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f182377a2ee2bb653b952eeb13f966cf2f67f41","amp;dn":"Ma%26eth%3Burin+i%26eth%3B+slapp+at+fara+%5BThe+Man+Who+Was+Allowed+to+Lea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f182377a2ee2bb653b952eeb13f966cf2f67f41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,24,35,119,162,238,43,182,83,185,82,238,177,63,150,108,242,246,127,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
