It was his first album to not create any top 40 singles in either the US or the UK since 1970's Tumbleweed Connection, which had no singles released from it. It is also the poorest-charting album of John's career. In 2006, Elton John declared this his least favourite of all his albums, while lyricist Bernie Taupin believes The Big Picture deserves that honour.\n\n\nAlbum Title: Leather Jackets \nArtist | Group: Elton John \nLabel: Rocket Records \nRelease date: 1986 \nGenre: Pop \nNumber of track(s): 11 \nFile format: mp3 \nTotal duration: 00h:46m:18s:378ms \nTotal size: 107.6724 MB\n\nTrack List:\nLeather Jackets\nHoop Of Fire\nDon't Trust That Woman (Cher/Lady Choc Ice)\nGo It Alone\nGypsy Heart\nSlow Rivers (Duet with Cliff Richard)\nHeartache All Over The World\nAngeline (John,Taupin,Carvell)\nMemory of Love (John/Gary Osborne)\nParis\nI Fall Apart\n\nENJOY \nplease seed and leave feedback\nvigoni","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3a9181adaedd81b40fd783f68f1ae5a9e4fd75d","amp;dn":"Elton+John+-+Leather+Jackets+%5B1986+-+MP3+-+320+kbps%5D+%5Bvigoni%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3a9181adaedd81b40fd783f68f1ae5a9e4fd75d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,169,24,26,218,237,216,27,64,253,120,63,104,241,174,90,158,79,215,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
