Chrono Trigger enslaves you, isolates you, and deprives you of sleep, food, and drink. It is the best RPG this reviewer has ever had the pleasure of playing - yes, it even beats out titles like Final Fantasy IV, Lunar: Silver Star Story, and Skies of Arcadia.\n\nChrono Trigger is the one RPG on the planet that truly seems to have everything: The amazing, unpredictable story, the endearing characters (characters even better than those in Final Fantasy VI), the excellent and very accessible battle system; well thought-out and rewarding side quests, tricky foes, and well-written dialogue. It was one of the first RPGs to feature multiple endings. What more could a die-hard role-player ever want? My only real problems with the game are the primitive graphics and sounds (but this game was originally released in the 16-bit era, when they were highly advanced for their time; therefore this complaint doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t count) and the length (20 hours, if that; maybe 25 tops if you complete all the side quests).\n\nThe word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChronoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in Chrono Trigger references three aspects of the game. The first is the main character, who is named Chrono. The second is one of the essential plot device items used in the game. The third, cleverly, is the story. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the turn of the millennium, and everyone is celebrating at a big fair. Our hero Chrono is an obligatory attendee, since his friend Lucca is performing a demo of her latest invention. Upon his arrival at the fair, Chrono quickly makes friends with a spunky young lady named Marle, and the two of them partake in LuccaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s demo of a teleportation device. The device works just fine on Chrono, but the mysterious pendant Marle is wearing causes her to disappear through a time vortex. Chrono (obviously thinking with the wrong head) and Lucca successfully initiate a rescue mission and, through a series of events, end up in a bleak, deep future.&quot;\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~CLEAN FILE~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n\n(Bane Draven) \nEmail - &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6507040b0001170413000b25090c13004b060a08&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e39b81828d8687918295868d9ba38f8a9586cd808c8e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nXbox Live - xBaneDravenx\nmyspace - /charlescoreystewart","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f68e597e0932855272f8dbe713e927295ac97e8c","amp;dn":"Chrono+Trigger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f68e597e0932855272f8dbe713e927295ac97e8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,142,89,126,9,50,133,82,114,248,219,231,19,233,39,41,90,201,126,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
