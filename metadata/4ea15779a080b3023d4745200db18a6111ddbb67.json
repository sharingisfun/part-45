This CD reissue is the only one of the trio that features Cobb as the only horn and backed by a pianist (Ray Bryant) instead of an organ player. With bassist Wendell Marshall, drummer Art Taylor and Ray Barretto on conga completing the group, most of the focus is on Cobb's tough yet flexible tenor. Such songs as &quot;When My Dreamboat Comes Home,&quot; &quot;Blues in the Closet&quot; and a remake of &quot;Flying Home&quot; make this the definitive Arnett Cobb album from the era. Highly recommended. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - When My Dream Boat Comes Home\n02 - Lonesome Road\n03 - Blues In The Closet\n04 - PartyTime\n05 - Flying Home\n06 - The Slow Poke\n07 - Cocktails For Two\n\nEnjoy and share!
