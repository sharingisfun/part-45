New events relating to idea group as well! \nNew graphics for pirate tech group and religion. \nThe ability to encite Colonial Nations to rebel against their overlords! If you have Espionage ideas and there is a colonial nation with at least 25 opinion of you can get an event to spend gold to give them liberty desire and a negative opinion modifier of their overlord. \nLetters of Marque can be offered to you via events - these gives you several bonuses as well as a special CB. \nAll the Republican triggered-only events have been replaced with completely new pirate-specific ones.\n\nBetween the years 1600 - 1750 an event will fire called &quot;The Golden Age of Piracy&quot; which gives a bunch of fun bonuses for a hundred years.

You will find it very difficult to make friends! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40bc424a2f41b99c0309011df23572bba7c323b3","amp;dn":"Haven%3A+A+Pirate+Nation+-+Europa+Universalis+IV+mod+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40bc424a2f41b99c0309011df23572bba7c323b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,188,66,74,47,65,185,156,3,9,1,29,242,53,114,187,167,195,35,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
