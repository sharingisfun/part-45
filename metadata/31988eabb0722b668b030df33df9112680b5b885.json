Rerecordings of Jordan&amp;#039;s 1940&amp;#039;s DECCA sides, supervised by Quincy Jones, were made in late 1956. The product of these sessions was indeed rock &amp; roll (thus this album&amp;#039;s title). But as had happened at ALADDIN, X and VIK just two years earlier, lightning didn&amp;#039;t strike twice for Louis-- sales of his newly polished oldies were less than what was hoped for. One last attempt to rekindle his career was made in August of &amp;#039;57, this time with a scaled-back band, but once again the records met with widespread indifference. Louis Jordan had officially become a casualty of the very music form he&amp;#039;d helped to create: ROCK &amp; ROLL.\n\nThe 21 tracks on this CD are an excellent sampling of Louis Jordan&amp;#039;s late 1950&amp;#039;s sound. Transfer quality of source material is superb. Included are session dates and personnel, as well as a two-page bio. An album of excellence that will please any Jordan fan, as well as those who enjoy early rock &amp; roll. (Amazon)\n\n\n\n01. Ain&amp;#039;t Nobody Here But Us Chickens\n02.
