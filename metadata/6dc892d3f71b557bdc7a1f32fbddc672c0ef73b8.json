A grand claim, perhaps, but there's little question that the addicting combination of Maynard James Keenan's aching voice and Billy Howerdel's accomplished songs and production skills made for one of 2000s best splashes in whatever was left of &quot;modern rock.&quot; That the band had in its initial pre-debut album tours performed an audacious, entertaining medley of Ozzy Osbourne's &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; and the Cure's &quot;Lovesong&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ regularly matching one's words with the other's music and vice versa Ã¢â‚¬â€ indicates where Mer de Noms ended up. Howerdel's earlier work with Billy Corgan makes perfect sense as a result, since the Pumpkins regularly fused the extreme theatricality of metal and goth just so, but Howerdel's work is no clone. His guitar work operates on setting the mood rather than driving everything before it, balancing sheer power with a textured approach that's quite beautiful. Nine Inch Nails-inspired touches crop up in the distorted percussion of many songs, such as &quot;Rose,&quot; but for all the derivations everything becomes its own smart fusion, with Keenan's vocals the killer touch. His abilities in delivering on-the-edge emotional collapse had long been clear thanks to Tool Ã¢â‚¬â€ here, with a slightly different musical bed to carry things, he often holds back from complete explosiveness, but it's still clearly him, just about to crack. His astonishing call-and-response exchange on the single &quot;Judith&quot; marks another high point in his career. The choice of who else to make up the band was a smart one Ã¢â‚¬â€ Paz Lenchantin's violin and string arrangements add even further to the air of dark, moody mystery, while Josh Freese's abilities on drums once again come to the fore. Alan Moulder adds in some fine help on mixing, polishing the glowering sheen of Mer de Noms, Rovi\n\n\n\nB i o g r a p h y\n\nFormed by Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan and former Tool guitar tech Billy Howerdel, A Perfect Circle is an extension of the alt-metal-fused-with-art rock style popularized by Tool in the early to mid-'90s. While similar to Tool in intensity and melancholy, A Perfect Circle is less dark and more melodic, with a theatrical, ambient quality that incorporates occasional strings and unusual instrumentation.\n\nAfter the release of Ãƒâ€ nima in 1996, Tool found themselves in the midst of an extended legal battle with former label Freeworld Entertainment. When the dust settled two years later, the band reached a 50/50 joint venture agreement for future recordings and, feeling a little burned out, decided to take some time off. It was at this point that Keenan joined up with Howerdel and Paz Lenchantin to form A Perfect Circle. Keenan had met Howerdel in 1992 when Tool opened for Fishbone. Howerdel had been Fishbone's tech at the time and had played Keenan a few of his songs. Keenan was impressed and the two talked of collaborating in the future. However, the opportunity didn't present itself until after the Freeworld settlement. With Keenan on vocals, Howerdel on guitar, and Lenchantin on bass, the trio recruited ex-Failure and Enemy member Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar and ex-Vandals and Guns N' Roses member Josh Freese on drums.\n\nThe quintet rehearsed together but didn't announce the formation of a new band until performing for the first time on August 15, 1999, at a benefit concert at the Viper Room in Los Angeles. Howerdel, who had been composing songs for years, as well as working with bands such as the Smashing Pumpkins and Nine Inch Nails, became the band's chief songwriter and producer. A Perfect Circle released their debut album, Mer de Noms, in 2000. Thirteenth Step followed in 2003, and the covers album Emotive appeared in 2004.\n\nShortly after the release of their DVD set aMOTION, A Perfect Circle went on hiatus. During their downtime, Keenan went on to record albums with his solo project, Puscifer, while Howerdel began making albums with his new band, Ashes Divide. While rumors of the band writing songs cropped up now and again, A Perfect Circle returned (to the stage, at least) in 2010, and released their first new song, &quot;By and Down,&quot; on their 2013 greatest-hits compilation, Three Sixty.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dc892d3f71b557bdc7a1f32fbddc672c0ef73b8","amp;dn":"A+Perfect+Circle+-+Mer+De+Noms+-+Live","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dc892d3f71b557bdc7a1f32fbddc672c0ef73b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,200,146,211,247,27,85,123,220,122,31,50,251,221,198,114,192,239,115,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
