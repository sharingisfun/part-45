The relocated-Brit began the project following a move to CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s East Coast and soon caught the attention of his adoptive home, recording the highly-acclaimed self-titled debut with Michael Feuerstack (Snailhouse, Bell Orchestre, the Luyas) producing and Arcade Fire drummer Jeremy Gara mixing. The album, released on Forward Music in Canada and Ferryhouse in Germany, Austria, Switzerland found its way onto BBC and CBC airwaves as well as best-of the year lists in Canada, Europe and as far afield as Mexico and Japan.\n\nPaper Beat Scissors was billed as a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmust-seeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ act of the summer by the CBC in 2012. PBS has toured Canada and Europe, sharing the stage with the likes of Mark Kozelek (Sun Kil Moon/Red House Painters) and Dan Mangan. An onstage collaboration with Clogs (regular collaborators and members of the National and My Brightest Diamond) was released as a limited-edition 7? for International Record Store Day 2013. Tim is presently working with engineer Dean Nelson (Beck, Thurston Moore, Bat for Lashes) on a new album set for release in 2014.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Absolutely stunning... wonderful... startling and beautifulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhisperingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Bob Harris, BBC Radio 2 \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t merely indie folk music: Paper Beat Scissors is a genuine work of effortless art.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pop Matters \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“CrabtreeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more than one to watch, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one to listen to, now.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Americana UK \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦potent enough for an otherworld experience.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ CBC ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23360c73f256948a76d0cc702d685f248af2a328","amp;dn":"Paper+Beat+Scissors+-+Paper+Beat+Scissors%5B2013%5D+%5BEAC.Log%2CCue.FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23360c73f256948a76d0cc702d685f248af2a328","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,54,12,115,242,86,148,138,118,208,204,112,45,104,95,36,138,242,163,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
