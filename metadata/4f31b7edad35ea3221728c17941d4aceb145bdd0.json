Only a 600 dpi scan would do justice to Watterson's masterful sable-brush strokes.\n\nIf you like Watterson's work, please consider buying this: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Complete-Calvin-Hobbes-v/dp/0740748475&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Complete-Calvin-Hobbes-v/dp/0740748475&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt's completely worth it - beautiful quality!.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f31b7edad35ea3221728c17941d4aceb145bdd0","amp;dn":"Calvin+and+Hobbes+complete+cartoons+1985-1995","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f31b7edad35ea3221728c17941d4aceb145bdd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,49,183,237,173,53,234,50,33,114,140,23,148,29,74,206,177,69,189,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
