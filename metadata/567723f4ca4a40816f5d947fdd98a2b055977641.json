After the show, Tucker -- whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d been on hiatus with Sleater-Kinney since 2006 -- decided to turn those new songs into an album. She took the material to Little Gold Book Studios in northeast Portland, where she began recording the 11-track record with help from percussionist Sara Lund (of Hungry Ghost) and Golden Bears members Seth Lorinczi and Julianna Bright. The resulting album, 1,000 Years, was released in 2010.\n\nReleased: 2010\nLabel: Kill Rock Stars\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie\nQuality: 320kbps mp3\n\nTracks:\n\n  1. 1,000 Years\n  2.
