Still traumatized by memories of the Las Vegas fiasco, Stu (Ed Helms) vows to keep his pre-wedding partying to the bare minimum. But when Phil (Bradley Cooper), Doug (Justin Bartha), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) show up, Stu's low-key brunch makes their previous Vegas fiasco look like a family trip to Disneyland. The Hangover Part II features cameos by Bill Clinton and Paul Giamatti. \n\nRipped with Handbrake\n\nLength: 1 Hour 42 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 1264\n\nFrame Height: 528\n\nFrame Rate: 29fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e6f0dcfde9e5b7953789c422b86f0692f47295e","amp;dn":"The+Hangover+Part+2%282011%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e6f0dcfde9e5b7953789c422b86f0692f47295e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,111,13,207,222,158,91,121,83,120,156,66,43,134,240,105,47,71,41,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
