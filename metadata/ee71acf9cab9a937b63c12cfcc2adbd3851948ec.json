When their vessel, the Nightingale 229, answers an emergency distress signal from a comet mining operation in a distant galaxy, the crew soon finds itself in danger from the mysterious young man they rescue, the alien artifact he's smuggled aboard, and the gravitational pull of a giant star about to supernova. The resulting explosion will be the most massive explosion in the universe.\r\n\r\nDirector: Walter Hill (as Thomas Lee)\r\nWriters: William Malone (story), Daniel Chuba (story) | 1 more credit Â»\r\nStars: James Spader, Peter Facinelli, Robin Tunney | See full cast &amp; crew Â»","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee71acf9cab9a937b63c12cfcc2adbd3851948ec","amp;dn":"SUPERNOVA+2000+DVDrip+x264+AAC+COSMOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee71acf9cab9a937b63c12cfcc2adbd3851948ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,113,172,249,202,185,169,55,182,60,18,207,204,42,219,211,133,25,72,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
