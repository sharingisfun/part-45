She writes in a direct style that manages to incorporate interesting turns of phrase, knotty combinations of words, and evocative imagery. &quot;Social Wedding Rings&quot; deftly dissects circle-of-friends politics, neither lambasting nor condoning those interrelationships but finding a finer balance between fond remembrance and bitter regret. Even singing about hanging out in Colorado Springs and listening to Buffy Sainte-Marie, she's makes the song specific to her own experience yet sympathetic enough to apply to any listener. On &quot;Lament&quot;, McEntire slyly subverts love-song conventions to write a declaration of love's opposite: &quot;A mouthful of bees couldn't stop me from whisperin', 'I don't love you,'&quot; she sings with a steeliness in her phrasing, right before the handclaps come in. Her repulsion is just as intense and wild as the attraction and excitement of first love.\nDominated by shuffling drums, slow southern rock guitar licks, and pedal steel, the music on Mount Moriah is unobtrusive and reserved-- at times almost too much so-- but there are some fine flourishes in these songs, which feature members of Megafaun, St. Vincent, and Bowerbirds. The strings on &quot;Old Gowns&quot; quiver and sob, as if allowing McEntire to maintain her composure, and Miller's steady, chiming guitar theme on &quot;Lament&quot; gives her something to lean on. The music isn't as distinctive as the singer, but the band's mission is to support, not compete with, her performance. The accompaniment is understated by necessity, because what else can you do when the album's finest moment is McEntire singing wordlessly and eloquently on &quot;Old Gowns&quot;, sustaining a single syllable to show the full, gorgeous grain of her voice?\nBy Stephen M. Deusne\n\n2.(2013) Mount Moriah - Miracle Temple\nGenre: Indie Folk\nQuality: 320 kbps\nTracklist:\n01 - Younger Days.mp3\n02 - Bright Light.mp3\n03 - Eureka Springs.mp3\n04 - I Built a Town.mp3\n05 - White Sands.mp3\n06 - Connecticut to Carolina.mp3\n07 - Rosemary.mp3\n08 - Swannanoa.mp3\n09 - Miracle Temple Holiness.mp3\n10 - Union Street Bridge.mp3\n11 - Those Girls.mp3\n12 - Telling the Hour.mp3\n\nREVIEW:\nMcEntire chews her words with an enunciative license learned from old Vic Chesnutt albums, while he lays down some licks that are showy only in their tonal precision, his lower notes suggesting a subtle grinding of gears. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the rhythm section that turns Mount MoriahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s country into country soul, their tight timekeeping giving the song its backbone, its drive for introspection and epiphany. As McEntireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrics imply, giving in to the darkness may be the only way to survive it, but the songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s irrepressible momentum makes sure she sees the bright light on the other side.\nBy Stephen M.
