Over the\nyears the number of bandsmen gradually increased and quality was raised, partly\nby engaging former military bandsmen and, in more recent decades, musicians\nwith civilian college of music training. As long as the band belonged to the\ntramways it was stipulated that bandsmen served as tram drivers etc. during\npart of their working time.\nSince 1992 the orchestra has been organised as a foundation.\nGWO's home venue is Gothenburg's oldest secular building &quot;The Crown house&quot;\n(1654), where concerts are performed all year round. ln addition, the orchestra\ntours the Gothenburg region, occasionally also abroad.\n\nThe orchestra has performed under the following names:\n\nGÃƒÂ¶teborg Wind Orchestra (GWO) 2007-\n1997 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2008 they were commissioned to perform as The Swedish Air Force Band.\nGÃƒÂ¶teborgsMusiken 1992 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2007\n1905 - 1991 GÃƒÂ¶teborgs SpÃƒÂ¥rvÃƒÂ¤gars MusikkÃƒÂ¥r(Gothemburg TramwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Band)\n\n\nSwedish release 2002: GÃƒÂ¶teborgsMusiken - Swedish music for wind band\nInt. release: 2002: Swedish music for wind band\nConductor: Jerker Johansson\nRecorded at Church of HemsjÃƒÂ¶ 27-29 November 2000\nTracks 2-4, piano: Joakim Kallhed\n\nWith art-work\n\n01  GWO - Swedish music for wind band - Fest-ouverture, op. 26\n02  GWO - Swedish music for wind band - Pianokonsert nr 3, I.
