Enjoy!!\n\n- Haymose\n\n\nThis is a Mac clone of the game Geometry Wars. It's a bright, flashy, and fun vector-graphics shooter, vaguely reminiscent of Asteroids- if you played Asteroids while tripping acid. ;D\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/3/8/4/f_gw1m_8d791bd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img34.picoodle.com/img/img34/3/8/4/f_gw1m_8d791bd.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor an (overly) in-depth analysis of the game, visit http://worldofstuart.excellentcontent.com/grid/wars.htm\n\nThis game is for Mac OS X and is written for the PPC processor, but runs fine on Intel Macs (tested on a Macbook Pro with 10.4.11). Leopard compatibility is untested. It was originally released as a free game, but when Geometry Wars (the original) started getting too popular, the programmer was forced to take the clone off his site- I just managed to grab it from a random site still hosting it\n\n-Shrak\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73cff76372ffc63da19bdd4dfb150e36693770ad","amp;dn":"Grid+Wars+2%2A%2AFIXED%2A%2AMAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73cff76372ffc63da19bdd4dfb150e36693770ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,207,247,99,114,255,198,61,161,155,221,77,251,21,14,54,105,55,112,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
