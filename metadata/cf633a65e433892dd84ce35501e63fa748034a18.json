Its original members were brothers Gary and Brad Pinto, Andrew De Silva and Danny Williams. Jude Nicholas joined the group when De Silva left.\n\nOriginally from Dandenong, the band formed in 1991 as teenagers and performed local gigs for several years before being signed to Sony in 1994. Prior to this, the band provided backing vocals to Peter Andre in a number of his songs. Their debut album was Glide With Me, from which the first two singles &quot;Hook Me Up&quot; and &quot;Hey Girl&quot; were successful. It was the third single, which launched them into the public. The group did a cover song of &quot;Let's Groove&quot; by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and it reached number 2 on the Australian singles chart in 1995 and selling about 70,000 singles. Glide With Me went on to generate 4 hit singles in total and went platinum.\n\nFollowing the success of Glide With Me, the band announced an upcoming fifth single &quot;Freak Show&quot;, however it was never released.\n\nA second album, Lifted, was released in 1997. Jude Nicholas joined the group for this release, replacing Andrew De Silva. The album featured a more pop-oriented sound and was much less successful than their first. The album produced 3 singles. Originally, Sony Music intended to release the title track as a single in its own right but the album was instead later repackaged and released together with another single, &quot;So Badd&quot;, in an attempt to generate further sales which proved to be unsuccessful. The track, which initially featured on the first printing, was re-recorded to replace the vocals of De Silva with those of Nicholas.\n\nThere was word of a third album being recorded but this did not eventuate as a result of the band's demise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf633a65e433892dd84ce35501e63fa748034a18","amp;dn":"CdB+-+The+Essential+CDB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf633a65e433892dd84ce35501e63fa748034a18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,99,58,101,228,51,137,45,216,76,227,85,1,230,63,167,72,3,74,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
