Why was the startling success of his campaigns in Poland and France followed by the blundering mistakes in Russia, Tunis and Normandy? Might the German General Staff have won the war without Hitler's continual disastrous interference? John Strawson answers these and other questions by showing how Hitler's insatiable preoccupation with war and conquest was translated into reality. While the willpower behind the revitalized German army was Hitler's the author examines the Fuhrer's eccentric use of the most formidable war machine the world had ever seen. This lucid assessment is brought alive by the accounts of those who served Hitler both on his staff and as field commanders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:255004b2cf5e9a9beb6377e4a0af17a02554f82f","amp;dn":"Hitler+As+Military+Commander","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"255004b2cf5e9a9beb6377e4a0af17a02554f82f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,80,4,178,207,94,154,155,235,99,119,228,160,175,23,160,37,84,248,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
