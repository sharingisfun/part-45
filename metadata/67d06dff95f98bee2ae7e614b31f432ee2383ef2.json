Guided by the insights of a Buddhist monk, the film offers unprecedented access into Myanmar and the plight of opium growers, soldiers, villagers, poachers and prospectors, each connected by the reconstruction of an ancient road and is impact on their environment .\n\nOnce all Burma was known as The Golden Land, but for the 135 distinct trib people that live in present day Myanmar. In the years since independence from Britain, their land has been beset by ethnic strife, civil war, the failure of socialism and long periods of military rule. Since 2003, both the US Government and the European Union have imposed economic sanctions, isolating the country and its leadership.\n\nSo what does the future hold? How can the Burmese regain the peaceful balance they so desperately crave? The answer lies in renewal, though this could well begin, not with democratic elections, but from a very different quarter. The path to Burma's peace and prosperity may commence with the rebuilding of a remote and ancient road!\n\nFar to the north on Burma's frontiers with China and India winds a rutted and muddy trail - the legendary Burma Road. Once it carried the treasures of the Silk Road, then in the last years of WWII it became the vital ribbon that delivered Burma from Japanese occupation only to fall into ruin as Burma closed her borders and withdrew into isolation.\n\nWill the road be a path for change? In connecting the burgeoning economies of China and India, will it be a boon for Burma as the'halfway house', with the resulting trade and international exchange transporting it out of its isolation?\n\nOr, will it be the road to ruin? Once completed, will it tear open Burma's last great wilderness and invite a massive uncontrolled grab for territory and resources, providing even easier access to militants, smugglers and drug runners?\n\nEither way, the road is a microcosm of all Burma; the future of the road is that of Myanmar. Today it is a tenuous lifeline for the few. Tomorrow, rebuilt, it could prove to be salvation for all|.\n\nFinanced by the US MacArthur Foundation and filmed and produced by an international crew with unprecedented access into Burma's remote northern territories, Burma's Open Road provides a unique opportunity to contemplate the spirit of Myanmar, its people and the road ahead from distinctively differentenvironmental perspectives. \n\n\n\nBurmas Open Road explores the lives of every day Burmese intertwined with the \nfortunes of Asias last great wilderness. Guided by the insights of a Buddhist monk, the film offers unprecedented access into Myanmar and the plight of opium growers, soldiers, villagers, poachers and prospectors, each connected by the reconstruction of an ancient road and is impact on their environment.\n\nDirname: Burmas.Open.Road.An.Insight.Into.Myanmar.HDTV.XViD-PiX\nFilename: pix-boraiim.hdtv.xvid\nDetails: 640 x 352 - 25.00fps - XviD VBR 1007kbps | MP3 VBR 128kbps | 357MB\n\n\n\n\n__________________________\n\n****Please say Thanks.****\n__________________________\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67d06dff95f98bee2ae7e614b31f432ee2383ef2","amp;dn":"Burma%5C%27s+open+road+an+insight+into+Myanmar+hdtv+xv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67d06dff95f98bee2ae7e614b31f432ee2383ef2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,208,109,255,149,249,139,238,42,231,230,20,179,31,67,46,226,56,62,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
