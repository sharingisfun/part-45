In 2007, Mary Anne returned from a humanitarian trip to Pakistan and Afghanistan suffering from what her doctors believed was a rare type of hepatitis. Months later she was diagnosed with a form of advanced pancreatic cancer, which is almost always fatal, often in six months or less. \n \n \nThis is the inspiring true story of a son and his mother, who start a Ã¢â‚¬Å“book clubÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that brings them together as her life comes to a close. Over the next two years, Will and Mary Anne carry on conversations that are both wide-ranging and deeply personal, prompted by an eclectic array of books and a shared passion for reading. Their list jumps from classic to popular, from poetry to mysteries, from fantastic to spiritual.  \n \nThe issues they discuss include questions of faith and courage as well as everyday topics such as expressing gratitude and learning to listen. Throughout, they are constantly reminded of the power of books to comfort us, astonish us, teach us, and tell us what we need to do with our lives and in the world. Reading isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the opposite of doing; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the opposite of dying. \n \n \nWill and Mary Anne share their hopes and concerns with each otherÃ¢â‚¬â€and rediscover their livesÃ¢â‚¬â€through their favorite books. When they read, they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a sick person and a well person, but a mother and a son taking a journey together. The result is a profoundly moving tale of loss that is also a joyful, and often humorous, celebration of life: WillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love letter to his mother, and theirs to the printed page. \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:801c2e11188d995debab8419fd57484b3203a56e","amp;dn":"The+End+of+Your+Life+Book+Club+by+Will+Schwalbe+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"801c2e11188d995debab8419fd57484b3203a56e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,28,46,17,24,141,153,93,235,171,132,25,253,87,72,75,50,3,165,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
