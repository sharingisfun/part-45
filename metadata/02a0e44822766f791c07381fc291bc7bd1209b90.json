Released in March 1995 on the album Relish and produced by Rick Chertoff, it became a top 40 hit in November of that year.\n\n   The song deals with various aspects of belief in God by asking questions inviting the listener to consider how they might relate to God, such as &quot;Would you call [God's name] to his face?&quot; or &quot;Would you want to see [God's face] if seeing meant that you would have to believe [in theological concepts]?&quot; The title of the song comes from the refrain, &quot;What if God was one of us?&quot;\n\n   In 1996, William A. Donohue, president of the Catholic League, took issue with the song. In light of the time and money that Osborne had donated to Planned Parenthood, Donahue claimed the song was agenda-driven and danced &quot;awfully close to the line of Catholic baiting&quot;.\n\n   The song received a Grammy nomination in 1995 for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.\n\n   In January 1996, &quot;One of Us&quot; hit the top 10. In March 1996, the song climbed to No. 1 on Rock On The Net's ARC Weekly Top 40 and stayed there for 2 weeks. Its peak chart position on the Billboard Hot 100 was #4.\n\n\n                                 ***One of Us.***\n\n                                       Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02a0e44822766f791c07381fc291bc7bd1209b90","amp;dn":"Joan+Osborne-One+Of+Us%281995%29%28Promo+Only%29-Wushan.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02a0e44822766f791c07381fc291bc7bd1209b90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,160,228,72,34,118,111,121,28,7,56,31,194,145,188,123,209,32,155,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
