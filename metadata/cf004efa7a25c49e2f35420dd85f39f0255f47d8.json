What am I talking about? A guest appearance by Johnny Rotten on the Capital Radio program of deep-voiced DJ Tommy Vance. Rotten/Lydon was invited to play records from his own collection and talk about them. He comes across as whip-smart, honest and refreshingly free from muchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½if anyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½social programing and religious brainwashing. He discusses the Sex Pistols, Malcolm McClaren (he calls him the fifth member of the band), being educated in a Catholic school he despised and his passionate love of music. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no put-on here or any hint of the deliberate obnoxiousness of later years.\n\nWhere did you go to school?\n\n[sighs] This poxy Roman Catholic thing. All they done was teach me religion. DidnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t give a damn about your education though. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not important is it? Just as long as you go out being a priest.\n\nWhich you havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t become.\n\nWell no. That kind of forcing ideas on you like when you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to know is bound to get the opposite reaction. They donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t let you work it out for yourselves. They tell you you should like it. And thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why I hate schools. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not given a choice. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not free.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an inevitable question, and a corny question, but can you think of any better system of educating people?\n\nNo I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t [laugh], I just know that oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not right. I wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t dare, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s out of my depth, I have nothing to do with that side of things. I havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t been to university and studied all the right attitudes, so I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know. No I havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t.\n\n[fades in Doctor Alimantado - ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Born For A Purpose ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“]\n\nThis is it, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Born For A PurposeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, right? Now this record, just after I got my brains kicked out, I went home and I played it and thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a verse which goes, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“If you have no reason for living, donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t determine my lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Because the same thing happened to him. He got run over because he was a dread. Very true.\n\nThe music he plays is a revelation.  Can, some rare soul, Tim Buckley, Peter Hammill (he accuses Bowie of copping the Van Der Graaf Generator front manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s moves), Captain Beefheart (he plays The Blimp!), Nico, John Cale and of course, lots of reggae. When Rotten plays the dub B-side by Culture (the track with the lopping bass, barking dogs, crying babies and blaring car horns) you can hear the blueprint for the PiL sound that would come along just a few months later.\n\nIt must be said that for a 19-year-old heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s got astonishingly good taste in music. This really is an incredible thing to listen to. For the musical education alone, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great, but listening to the thoughts of this controversial, brilliant young man at the height of powers is a sublime pleasure. It even contains the radio commercials from the broadcast.\n\nA transcript of the interview and a track listing can be found on http://www.fodderstompf.com/ARCHIVES/REVIEWS%202/capital77.html\n\nText above copy-pasted from http://www.dangerousminds.net/index.php/site/comments/johnny_rotten_plays_his_own_records_on_capital_radio_1977/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf004efa7a25c49e2f35420dd85f39f0255f47d8","amp;dn":"Johnny+Rotten+Capital+Radio+July+15th+1977","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf004efa7a25c49e2f35420dd85f39f0255f47d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,0,78,250,122,37,196,158,47,53,66,13,216,95,57,240,37,95,71,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
