It revolves around Trace, a human who has lost his memory, and his anthropomorphic Tiger-girl friend, Flora.\n\nAlong their way, they discover that the world is in a state of near open war, with Flora's race, the Keidran, openly targeted for enslavement and slaughter by the humans, led by the murderous Templars. Meanwhile, they discover Keith, a member of the mostly forgotten Basitin race.\n\nQuickly caught up in the politics of the world Ã¢â‚¬â€ and its gods Ã¢â‚¬â€ Trace and Flora travel eastward, interested in finding out more about Trace's past, as well as a place a Human with a dark (and forgotten) past, a misfit Keidran, and an outcast Basitin can call home.\n\nWhile they may not show anything, there are still NSFW moments.
