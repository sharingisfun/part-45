But it has a dark alter ego that lies 30 metres under the ground, mirroring centuries of bloody wars, revolutions and riots on the surface. For Paris is porous - built on 177 miles of tunnels that were formed when limestone and gypsum were quarried to build the capital. Most people are only aware of just a tiny fraction of these tunnels - the world famous ossuary known as The Catacombs. The authorities have tried to keep a lid on the full extent of the labyrinthine remainder for hundreds of years. But there are little known entry points everywhere - in basements, in train stations, cellars and sewers. Throughout history, invaders have always found a way in, whether they were fighting Prussian soldiers, fleeing royalty of the French Revolution, the Nazis or The Resistance. Today they're home to the cataphiles - urban explorers who use the tunnels as an art space, a music venue or even a clandestine meeting point for secret societies. The Guardian's architecture and design correspondent Jonathan Glancey investigates the underground maze of Paris, revealing a mysterious and intriguing history.\n\n------- File Information ---------\nBroadcast BBC R4X, 30 Jan 2012\nMPEG 1.0 Layer 3 - 128 kbps mp3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 44 khz - Joint Stereo\nDuration: 28 Mins\nCaptured with Radio Downloaded, topped &amp; tailed with mp3DirectCut","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6244bbc03fc56c398a3129b35ec4ccbcc8265b8f","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Catacombs+of+Paris+++%28BBC+R4+-+2012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6244bbc03fc56c398a3129b35ec4ccbcc8265b8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,68,187,192,63,197,108,57,138,49,41,179,94,196,204,188,200,38,91,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
