On his new album as Owen, Mike Kinsella continues to gracefully mature aspects of that largely adolescent genre. Throughout LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ami du Peuple, he reflects on pain, admits confusion and frustration, but looks for the contrast.\nAs always, Kinsella comes across as well-read, thoughtful, and concerned, reflecting the veteran musicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early CapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢n Jazz days as much as his new fatherhood. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nearing 40, and looking around the room to wonder how we all got there. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I can see some guys give up/ How good apples go bad,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he sighs on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love Is Not EnoughÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clearly changing as well; the Chicago mainstay is incorporating electronics, strings, and other wrinkles into his once largely acoustic style.\n\nHis pains are still there, though, driving things. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You said something, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not listening/ My whole world is caving in,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he bemoans on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who CaresÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a curlicued guitar line branching in veins. The rough-edged stomper Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bad BloodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ traces out an emotionally troubled family tree (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Poor grandfather so shy/ CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave the house without a tall oneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). The haunted Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blues to BlackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ watches time pass, a memory of a lost love (beautifully summed in the line Ã¢â‚¬Å“I watch myself move as if you were hereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) fading from a piercing nightmare to a dulled memory.\n\nBut Kinsella seems to have found some answers, or at least some respite. Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re better off holding your freak flag high,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he croons in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bad BloodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Time passes and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still alive, still feeling, less shattered. Ã¢â‚¬Å“How long have I been sleepinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢?/ IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a dad and my dadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dead,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he calls out on closer Ã¢â‚¬Å“Vivid DreamsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The song recalls crystalized moments of pain, of when Ã¢â‚¬Å“life became a lie.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But then, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I woke up/ IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m so glad I found you.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ A lilting piano line drifts into the acoustic guitar bubble, lifting things out of their somnambulance. LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ami du Peuple, or Ã¢â‚¬Å“friend of the people,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ does the job its title promises: a man of sensitive depth and veteran pain offering light at the end of the tunnel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8bfa98d8803a4c12c2ada11f9ba5d395c455d45","amp;dn":"Owen+-+L%27Ami+du+Peuple+%5B2013%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8bfa98d8803a4c12c2ada11f9ba5d395c455d45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,191,169,141,136,3,164,193,44,42,218,17,249,186,93,57,92,69,93,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
