In the no man's land between East and West (the Wall has not yet been built), an abandoned train station serves as the meeting place for two people: Carl, a West-German border official, and Anna, an East-German factory worker. After meeting and falling in love, they start preparing for a future in the West for themselves and Anna's young son. Helmut KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤utner was one of the first to deal with the impossibility of love across the borders between &quot;the two Germanies&quot; during the times of the Cold War. His film was a become a stinging indictment of the border which tore German apart.\n\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Himmel ohne Sterne.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.36 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 43mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 886 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 43mn\n      Bit rate : 1 684 Kbps\n      Width : 688 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.255\n      Stream size : 1.22 GiB (89%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 43mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 142 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\nIMDB: tt0048169\n\nGerman audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese srt, multilanguage (German, English, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Japanese, Russian) sub/idx\n\nHelmut Kautner - Himmel ohne Sterne [1955]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74ae9c149dfa2e31c4c6926de80964cf5867f182","amp;dn":"Helmut+Kautner+-+Himmel+ohne+Sterne+%5B1955%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74ae9c149dfa2e31c4c6926de80964cf5867f182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,174,156,20,157,250,46,49,196,198,146,109,232,9,100,207,88,103,241,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
