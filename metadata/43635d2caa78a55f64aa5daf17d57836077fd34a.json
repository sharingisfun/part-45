Some return to visit after their first year exuding the vibe of conquering heroes. Others look, well, pretty bummed out. This book offers a plan to help the new college student complete Year #1 as a member of the first group. With anecdotes from current college students and recent graduates, the book presents five simple rules: Rule #1: Go to Class - I've never known a kid who flunked out of college who attended all his or her classes. Rule #2: Study 3 Hours X 5 days per week - How to transition from homework to study. Rule #3: Commit to Something - Don't drown in free time. Here's how to stay afloat. Rule #4: Get a Mentor - How to set up a support system. Rule #5: Procrastination Kills - How to rise above. The book is a short, non-preachy, fun, and tad irreverent primer that can help you get off to a strong start toward the 'best four years of your life.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n[img]http://www.hotimg.com/direct/ce2Zat5.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/5daf/9dacd213.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43635d2caa78a55f64aa5daf17d57836077fd34a","amp;dn":"College+Success+Guaranteed+%3A5+Rules+to+Make+it+Happen+2011+-Mant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43635d2caa78a55f64aa5daf17d57836077fd34a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,99,93,44,170,120,165,95,100,170,93,175,23,213,120,54,7,127,211,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
