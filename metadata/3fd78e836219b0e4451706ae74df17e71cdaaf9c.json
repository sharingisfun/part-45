In fact, there continue at present to be many developments in the subject of a very fundamental nature, such as implications for the foundations of physics, physics of entanglement, geometric phases, gravity and cosmology and elementary particles as well. It is hoped the papers in this volume will provide a much needed resource for researchers with regard to current topics of research in this growing area.\n\nAuthor: Paul Bracken\nTitle: Advances in Quantum Mechanics\nPublisher: InTech\nYear: 2013\nFormat: PDF\n\n\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
