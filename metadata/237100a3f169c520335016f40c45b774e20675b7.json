With no saxophonist this second time around, it's just Willette and Green in the solo spotlight, and they play marvelously off of one another. As a soloist, Willette has a nimble, airy touch, and though he owes no debt to the modal style of Larry Young, he has a greater melodic imagination than many of his instrument's straight blues players. What's more, his playing is far less in-the-pocket than his inspiration, Jimmy Smith's; Willette can really make a groove percolate, whether he's soloing or adding keen rhythmic interest with his left hand ( witness the throbbing slow blues of 'Chances Are Few' or the marching beat of 'Soul Walk' ). Green is in prime form as well, in particular contributing some unbearably lovely solos to the standard 'At Last.' Nearly every selection is memorable, with other highlights coming from Willette's manic original 'Jumpin' Jupiter,' a breezy treatment of 'Willow Weep for Me,' and Nat Adderley's jauntily swinging 'Worksong.' There's nary a bit of sleepy meandering on this set of grooves; each musician is plugged in and ready to wail. With Blue Note's extraordinary stable of talent, it's a shame that Willette never led another session for the label, which makes Stop and Listen that much more essential for soul-jazz fans. ~ by Steve Huey, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nBaby Face Willette ( Organ ) \nGrant Green ( Guitar ) \nBen Dixon ( Drums ) \n\nTracks:\n01  Willow Weep For Me ( Ann Ronell ) 8:14 \n02  Chances Are Few ( Babyface Willette ) 7:42 \n03  Jumpin' Jupiter ( Babyface Willette ) 5:11 \n04  Stop And Listen ( Babyface Willette ) 4:36 \n05  At Last ( Mack Gordon/Harry Warren ) 7:18 \n06  Soul Walk ( Babyface Willette ) 5:24 \n07  Work Song ( Nat Adderley/Oscar Brown, Jr. ) 4:51 \n08  The Can't Take That Away from Me ( George Gerschwin/Ira Greschwin ) 6:25\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:237100a3f169c520335016f40c45b774e20675b7","amp;dn":"Baby+Face+Willette+-+Stop+and+Listen+%281961%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"237100a3f169c520335016f40c45b774e20675b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,113,0,163,241,105,197,32,51,80,22,244,12,69,183,116,226,6,117,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
