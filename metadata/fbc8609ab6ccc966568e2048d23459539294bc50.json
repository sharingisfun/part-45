Seeding takes up 3/4 of my up bandwidth, and I have to use this machine for work. Thus, I can&amp;#039;t seed long. \n\nMannheim Steamroller is a collaboration of classical musicians headed by Chip Davis. Although usually classified as &quot;new age&quot;, the music is classical by the technical definition, and is termed &quot;18th century rock&quot; by Chip Davis.\n\nMost famous for their christmas albums, the works here represent their first four albums. In my opinion it is the most representative of the group&amp;#039;s compositional skills and musical talents, because they were produced before their massive commercial success and subsequent catering to public preferences. There are eight Freshe Aire albums. These first four were intended to represent the four seasons (I = spring; II = autumn; III = summer; IV = winter). The most spectacular works to my mind are Toccata (III) and G Major Toccata (IV). When I sold stereo equipment I used these two for demonstration cuts. Not only did I sell much equipment this way, almost invariably the customers also purchased a copy of one of more of the albums, as did many of those who did not buy equipment.\n\nEncoded in MP3 320 kbps CBR.\n\nPLEASE SEED. Thank you.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbc8609ab6ccc966568e2048d23459539294bc50","amp;dn":"Mannheim+Steamroller+-+Fresh+Aire+I+through+IV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbc8609ab6ccc966568e2048d23459539294bc50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,200,96,154,182,204,201,102,86,142,32,72,210,52,89,83,146,148,188,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
