The problem is immediately evident under headphones\nor any sound system with good Stereo seperation.\n.\nAll stereo has an important mono component - the primary speaker(s). We've been\nculturally taught since the invention of radio to count on the primary voice being\ndead center of your attention, be it an old timey radio grille or the center of a\nvideo screen.\n.\nThe goof, of course is that the primary voice here is only in the left channel.\nThey left the right channel half of it out altogether. So, the simplest move\nwould be to mix the two lopsided stereo (3/4 L, 1/4 R) signals down to one\nmono track where everything comes from dead center. But mono is so '70s.\n.\nI like my solution better - balanced primary voice and stereo sounds and\npresence to boot. Betcha can't guess what I did? (I have the 'touch'?)\nIt's a power we all have within us ... I'm just a little more full of it ... heh\n.\n========= IMDB.com/title/tt1821681/\n\nRelease Name: Touch.S02E04.Perfect.Storm.WEB-DL.XVID-AVIGUY.avi\n.\nFrom AVIGUY:\nRelease Date.: 20130225\nRelease Size: 286 Mb\nRun Time.......: 43:59\nResolution.....: 640x360\nVideo Codec...: XVID\nVideo Bitrate..: 768 Kbps\nAudio: MP3 160kbps 44KHz VBR\n.\nDon't get your hopes up over this series.

Kring, Tim Kring.\nHere's how you can tell - try watching every other episode - makes the same sense.\nNow, if Joss Whedon were doing this, boyo!
