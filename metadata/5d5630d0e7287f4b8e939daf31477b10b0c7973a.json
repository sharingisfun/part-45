Based on a real life experience of one of us, the production of this work took 2 years, because honestly, we didn't had the money to produce it.\n\nHear the explosive musical work of a mind with something to say and, by this way, let out the experience that changed his life. 53 minutes of progressive rock created to hit your face, mind and ears in a sound that combines virtuosity, feel and power!  \n\nWhy didn't we sell it?.-\n\nWell because it is a honest work, not a work for make money, if you want to pay for it, great, but in the mean time we will not charge for it because the idea is to see you, in front of us and jump with the power of music. Cheers!\n\nSong list:\n\n1. Incoming\n2. Denial\n3. Rage\n4. Depression\n5. Hope\n6. I want to set the world on fire\n7. Can you feel it burn?\n8. No more rules\n9. Looking into the city\n10.
