Now when you click on a creature the button will show up on a special bar that will slide out and can be moved anywhere you want on the screen. You can choose to disable this feature in the options under Slide Bar.If you disable the slide bar then the Creature Detector button will go back to the default UI if it available. We intend to expand upon this feature in the future to give you more control over your guide experience.\n\n[B] Professions List\nUpdated Tailoring for both Horde and Alliance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac8480b6c50a72015586dd68e1897df495b8f026","amp;dn":"Zygor+Guides+4.0.5895+%28February+15th%2C+2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac8480b6c50a72015586dd68e1897df495b8f026","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,132,128,182,197,10,114,1,85,134,221,104,225,137,125,244,149,184,240,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
