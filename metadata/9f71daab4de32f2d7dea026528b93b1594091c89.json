Abrams | 1972 | ISBN: 0810920492 | English | 152 pages | PDF | 16.5 MB\r\n\r\nFor seven decades Norman Rockwell captured the essence of the American spirit, creating art for magazines (more than 300 Saturday Evening Post covers), children's books, calendars, and advertisements, heartwarming and poignant images that touch us still. Norman Rockwell traces the evolution of the artist and his craft through his paintings, sketches, and photographs of him at home. And, of course, there is the artwork itself; the diverse array of full-color reproductions here represent Americans at work, at play, at home, and fighting for the Four Freedoms during World War II","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f71daab4de32f2d7dea026528b93b1594091c89","amp;dn":"Norman+Rockwell+-+A+Sixty+Year+Retrospective+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f71daab4de32f2d7dea026528b93b1594091c89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,113,218,171,77,227,47,45,125,234,2,101,40,185,59,21,148,9,28,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
