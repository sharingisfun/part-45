Born in 1911, he naturally embraced the country-blues of his generation, while also maintaining the early medicine show roots he learned as a child. Sam's sometimes humorous and always impassioned monologues, combined with harp virtuosity (he sometimes played two of them at once), came from a life of dedicated showmanship built up after years of passing the hat for crowds of spectators. Since Sam was definitely under-recorded, he has gained status as one of those irreplaceable characters who fell through the cracks, making these sessions fortunate to have available. These tracks were originally released on the Trix label as Medicine Show Man, and are now available as Kickin' It on 32 Blues. Sam is accompanied separately on the disc by guitarists Baby Tate and Rufe Johnson, from two South Carolina sessions recorded in Spartanburg during 1970 and Jonesville two years later.\n\nmp3   320kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b09c4933619d4f12573e17191bbf5df758a634dd","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Peg+Leg+Sam+-+Kickin%5C%27+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b09c4933619d4f12573e17191bbf5df758a634dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,156,73,51,97,157,79,18,87,62,23,25,27,191,93,247,88,166,52,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
