(AAP, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9781482218305\r\n\r\nThis book offers a comprehensive presentation of the concepts, properties, and applications of complex materials. Authors of each chapter use a fundamental approach to define the structure and properties of a wide range of solids on the basis of the local chemical bonding and atomic order present in the material. Emphasizing the physical and chemical origins of different material properties, this important volume focuses on the most technologically important materials being utilized and developed by scientists and engineers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a554d121fd1b97e224118312c10b3be0de2426ae","amp;dn":"Chemistry+and+Physics+of+Complex+Materials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a554d121fd1b97e224118312c10b3be0de2426ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,84,209,33,253,27,151,226,36,17,131,18,193,11,59,224,222,36,38,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
