In doing\nso, it articulates a genealogical problematic of\nwhat history is and a more strictly focused\nreappraisal of Greek and Roman historical thought.\nAncient ideas of history have played a key role in\nmodern debates about history writing, from Kant\nthrough Hegel to Nietzsche and Heidegger, and from\nFriedrich Creuzer through George Grote and Theodor\nMommsen to Momigliano and Moses Finley; yet\nscholarship has paid little attention to the\ntheoretical implications of the reception of these\nideas. The essays in this collection cover a wide\nrange of relevant topics and approaches and boast\ndistinguished authors from across Europe in the\nfields of classics, ancient and modern history\nand the theory of historiography.\n\nThe Western Time of Ancient History:\nHistoriographical Encounters with the Greek and Roman Pasts\nBy: Alexandra Lianeri\nISBN13: 9780521883139\nFormat: PDF\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 371","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34a16f4518383904031a921f10890227b48b1a83","amp;dn":"The+Western+Time+of+Ancient+History+by+Alexandra+Lianeri.+PDF+%28P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34a16f4518383904031a921f10890227b48b1a83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,161,111,69,24,56,57,4,3,26,146,31,16,137,2,39,180,139,26,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
