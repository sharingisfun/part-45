There will, of course, be some who have never picked up this album, and so now would be the perfect opportunity for them to do so... Digitally remastered, this wonderful album - so often sitting at or close to the top of many 'all time best of...'lists - has never sounded better.\n\n1. Arms Of A Stranger\n2.
