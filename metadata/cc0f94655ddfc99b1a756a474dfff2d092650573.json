But to describe it in cinematic terms would risk slighting that bighearted, sneakily exhilarating voice that can finally be only the work of a masterful writer.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Sean Howe, author of Marvel Comics: The Untold Story\n\n&quot;BruniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiercely smart and delectably unpredictable first novel delivers again and again that most sought-after shiver up the spine, the chill that comes when you realize the world you thought you knew and understood is newer and stranger than you ever dared imagine. A genuine page-turner.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Kathryn Davis, author of The Thin Place\n\n&quot;Mixed into this novelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blustery atmosphere are gusts of contemporary masters, like Joy Williams, Lorrie Moore, Kelly Link, and Michael Chabon. This gave me the sort of reading experience I always hope for but almost never find: a world that somehow both resembles the one in which I live and is also unlike any other I've ever seen or read.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Stefan Merrill Block, author of The Story of Forgetting\n\n&quot;A brave and bold new voice, Bruni takes us on an unexpected adventure of love and loss, of beginnings and ends, all the while showing us what it really means to be a hero.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Alison Espach, author of The Adults","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc0f94655ddfc99b1a756a474dfff2d092650573","amp;dn":"The+Night+Gwen+Stacy+Died+-+Sarah+Bruni.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc0f94655ddfc99b1a756a474dfff2d092650573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,15,148,101,93,223,201,155,26,117,106,71,77,255,242,208,146,101,5,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
