The release follows his Polaris Music Prize-nominated debut release House of Balloons and his second album Thursday[9], both released earlier the same year. The project is the final installment in the trilogy of free albums released by The Weeknd in 2011.\nThe album was preceded by the release of the single, &quot;Initiation&quot;. Long-time collaborator Carlo &quot;Illangelo&quot; Montagnese returned to produce the bulk of the project, with other production contributions coming from Clams Casino and DropxLife of the XO crew. Rapper Juicy J contributes a short spoken-word interlude at the end of &quot;Same Old Song&quot;.\nEchoes of Silence received general acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics and fans, the album received an average score of 82, based on 16 reviews, which indicates &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.\n\nReleased\tDecember 21, 2011\nRecorded\t2011\nGenre\tContemporary R&amp;B, alternative, electronic\nLength\t45:45\nLabel\tXO\nProducer\tIllangelo, Clams Casino, DropxLife\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\n1.\t&quot;D.D.&quot; (cover of Michael Jackson's &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;) 4:34\n2.\t&quot;Montreal&quot; (incorporates France Gall's &quot;Laisse tomber les filles&quot;) 4:11\n3.\t&quot;Outside&quot;  4:19\n4.\t&quot;XO&quot;/&quot;The Host&quot;  7:24\n5.\t&quot;Initiation&quot; (co-produced by DropxLife)\t4:21\n6.\t&quot;Same Old Song&quot; (additional vocals by Juicy J)\t5:12\n7.\t&quot;The Fall&quot; (co-produced by Clams Casino) 5:46\n8.\t&quot;Next&quot;  6:02\n9.\t&quot;Echoes of Silence&quot;  4:00\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nSHA256:\t51dbab7a584ad6f5a436104aef6485975c5e085dc94e4ac18e84bfdd56f409a4\nFile name:\tThe Weekend - Echoes of Silence.torrent\nDetection ratio:\t0 / 42\nAnalysis date:\t 2012-04-16 13:52:27 UTC ( 3 minutes ago )\n\nVirus total to assure it's clean: https://www.virustotal.com/file/51dbab7a584ad6f5a436104aef6485975c5e085dc94e4ac18e84bfdd56f409a4/analysis/1334584347/\n\n\n\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0e939b1d43b32894385e5381936ce332275229e","amp;dn":"The+Weekend+-+Echoes+of+Silence+album+%28OVOXO%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0e939b1d43b32894385e5381936ce332275229e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,233,57,177,212,59,50,137,67,133,229,56,25,54,206,51,34,117,34,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
