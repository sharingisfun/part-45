OUT MANEUVERED... OUT THOUGHT... THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE IS TO CHANGE THE RULES.\n\nA minor accident at a German nuclear power plant, a Biological Warfare attack on the British Embassy in Washington, DC, and a secret arms deal combine to drive a trusted NATO Ally into an illegal alliance with a rogue Middle Eastern state. With the world hovering on the brink of war, a handful of U.S. Navy warships must track down and destroy a wolfpack of state-of-the-art submarines.\n\nTheir enemy is skilled in deception, and incredibly lethal. Out-gunned, out-maneuvered, and out-thought, the U.S. Navy crews must throw the rulebook out the window, and become every bit as devious and deadly as their enemy.\n\nIf they fail, the consequences are unthinkable...\n\nWinner of the Admiral Nimitz Award for Outstanding Naval Fiction, SEA OF SHADOWS has been compared to the works of Tom Clancy, Larry Bond, and Joe Buff.\n\n&quot;A timeless warrior epic. Jeff Edwards spins a stunning and irresistibly-believable tale of savage modern naval combat.&quot; -- JOE BUFF, Bestselling author of 'SEAS OF CRISIS,' and 'CRUSH DEPTH'\n\n&quot;Edwards wields politics and naval combat tactics with a skill equal to the acknowledged masters of military fiction.&quot; -- THE MILITARY PRESS\n\n&quot;... as close as you can get to naval surface combat without being shot at. Jeff Edwards has penned a fast, no-holds-barred thriller that never lets up. Highly recommended.&quot; -- JACK DuBRUL, Bestselling author of 'THE SILENT SEA,' and 'HAVOC'\nAbout the Author\nJeff Edwards is a retired U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer, and an Anti-Submarine Warfare Specialist.
