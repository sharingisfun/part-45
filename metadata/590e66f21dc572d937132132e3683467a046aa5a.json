Torey Hayden faced six emotionally troubled kids no other teacher could handle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ three recent arrivals from battle-torn Northern Ireland, badly traumatised by the horrors of war; an eleven-year-old boy, who only knew life inside an institution; an excitable girl, aggressive and sexually precocious at the age of eight; and seven-year-old Leslie, perhaps the most hopeless of all, unresponsive and unable to speak. But Torey's most daunting challenge turns out to be Leslie's mother, a stunning young doctor who soon discovers that she needs Torey's love and help just as much as the children. Ã¢â‚¬ËœJust Another KidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a beautiful illustration of nurturing concern, not only for a few emotionally disturbed children, but for one woman facing a personal battle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:590e66f21dc572d937132132e3683467a046aa5a","amp;dn":"Just+Another+Kid+-+Torey+Hayden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"590e66f21dc572d937132132e3683467a046aa5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,14,102,242,29,197,114,217,55,19,33,50,227,104,52,103,160,70,170,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
