They were unashamedly pop, to the point of padding the front of their trousers for television appearances. At the heart, however, was a string of catchy singalong singles written by George Michael (born Georgios Kyrriacos Panayiotou in London to a Greek restauranting family).\n\nGeorge met Wham!&amp;#039;s other half, Andrew Ridgeley, at school in the London suburb of Bushey, and in 1979 they started performing together as part of the ska-based band the Executive. When that group dissolved, they wrote songs, made demos, and rushed into a recording contract with the equally eager independent label Innervision, scoring an instant hit with &quot;Wham Rap!&quot; (they thought that &quot;wham&quot; was the sound they made when Michael and Ridgeley performed together). In order to move to a recording contract with Sony label Epic, Wham! was forced to walk away from most of the royalties from their debut album, Fantastic. None of that mattered when their 1984 single, &quot;Wake Me up Before You Go Go,&quot; became a worldwide hit, accompanied by a video of the pair cavorting in their sportswear. Almost immediately, George Michael started thinking of a solo career, and released &quot;Careless Whisper,&quot; issued in the U.S. under George Michael of Wham!\n\nWham!&amp;#039;s end came suddenly two years later, in 1985, reputedly when the group&amp;#039;s manager, Simon Napier-Bell (later to manage Take That), decided to sell a share of his management to a South African entertainment conglomerate. Supposedly, as part of a stand against South African politics, George Michael immediately announced Wham!&amp;#039;s breakup. They gave their farewell performance before a sold-out audience of 72,000 fans at London&amp;#039;s Wembley Stadium.\n\nGeorge Michael comfortably stepped straight into his own highly successful solo performing and recording career. Andrew Ridgeley&amp;#039;s post Wham! album, Son of Albert, sold poorly and produced just one minor hit, &quot;Shake.&quot;\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\n\n\nGeorge Michael\n\n\nGeorgios Kyriacos Panayiotou (George Michael) achieved fame in the duo Wham! in his native U.K. in 1982. Through 1986, he and his partner, Andrew Ridgeley, scored hit after hit in a variety of styles from rap to up-tempo pop to slow ballads. As songwriter and lead singer, Michael gradually overshadowed the group, and by the time they split, he was ready for a massively successful solo career. This began with the 1987 album Faith, which featured a series of chart-topping hit singles and sold more than seven million copies. That Michael had not achieved a similar critical success was evident from the title of his follow-up album, Listen Without Prejudice, Vol. 1, which must be considered a major commercial disappointment even though it sold a million copies, included two Top Ten hits, and hit number two. With Vol. 2 apparently shelved, Michael contributed several songs to the charity album Red Hot + Dance in 1992, and one of them, &quot;Too Funky,&quot; reached the Top 20.\n\nAfter the failure of Listen Without Prejudice, Michael engaged in a bitter legal battle with his record company, accusing them of not properly promoting the album and asking them to release him from his contract; he stated that he would refuse to release any records if he lost the lawsuit. He lost. After losing an appeal, Michael bought his way out of his Columbia contract and signed with the music division of Dreamworks, a fledgling entertainment corporation founded by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen. In 1996, he released Older, its sales clearly hampered by his long hiatus away from performing. In 1998, Michael made tabloid headlines when he was arrested for lewd conduct in a men&amp;#039;s public restroom at a park near his Beverly Hills home; following the incident, the singer appeared on CNN and publicly revealed his homosexuality. The covers collection Songs from the Last Century followed in late 1999. Five years later he returned with Patience, an ambitious album featuring the politically charged single &quot;Shoot the Dog.&quot; The 2006 compilation TwentyFive was followed by a world tour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWham - Album&amp;#039;s &amp; EP&amp;#039;s (1983 - 1997)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWham - Fantastic (1983)\n\n\nCD Pressing Information\n\nLabel: Epic\nCatalog#: EPC 450090 2\nFormat: CD\nCountry: Europe\nReleased: 1983\nGenre: Electronic, Hip Hop, Pop\nStyle: Pop Rap, Synth-pop\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n01.
