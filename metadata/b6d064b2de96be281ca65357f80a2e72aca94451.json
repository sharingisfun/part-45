It was published from November, 1981 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ January, 1984 by Pacific Comics, and lasted for thirteen issues, plus one Special.\n\nIn the last issues of the Pacific series, Kirby crafted an original story for Captain Victory which he tied in to the New Gods comic book that he had written and drawn for DC Comics in the 1970s.  It was suggested that Captain Victory was the son of Orion (of The New Gods.)  Orion was not specifically named, but a number of clues were planted, including equipment said to belong to Captain Victory's father that was identical to the astro-harness ridden by Orion in the earlier series.  Additionally, Captain Victory's grandfather, Blackmaas, was illustrated only as a cast shadow, but a shadow that to many readers bore a resemblance to Orion's father, Darkseid.\n\nAfter the end of Pacific Comics, no more was seen of Captain Victory, until Topps Comics attempted to revive the character as part of planned five-issue mini-series (which only lasted one issue, Victory 1, June 1994) before Topps cancelled all of the 'Kirbyverse' books in 1994.  This issue was a part of a more complex project named Secret City Saga.  \n\nIn 2000, Jack KirbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandson, Jeremy Kirby, launched Jack Kirby Comics, the fledgling companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only offering being a three-issue retelling of Captain Victory, reordered and rescripted by Jeremy.  The quality of issues, anyway, is judged fairly inferior to the originals, despite the interesting cover art. The title of the comic book is the same as the original from 1981. The 3rd issue was published exclusively on the web.\n\nIn late 2011, Dynamite Entertainment started a new series under the Kirby:  Genesis title, which used many of Kirby's created and owned characters (many unpublished,) including Captain Victory.  This led, in November 2011, to a new Captain Victory title.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6d064b2de96be281ca65357f80a2e72aca94451","amp;dn":"Captain+Victory+And+The+Galactic+Rangers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6d064b2de96be281ca65357f80a2e72aca94451","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,208,100,178,222,150,190,40,28,166,83,87,248,10,46,114,172,169,68,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
