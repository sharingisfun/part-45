The song was commissioned by Neiman Marcus to promote their Christmas card for the year, which featured an original sketch by artist Perry Barlow, who drew for the New Yorker magazines for many decades.\n\nJimmy Boyd&amp;#039;s record was actually condemned by the Catholic Church in Boston when it was first released on the grounds it mixed sex with Christmas. Boyd, aged thirteen, was widely photographed meeting with the Archdiocese to explain the song.\n\nOther versions of the song were recorded through the years by the likes of The Jackson Five, John Mellencamp, the Hampton String Quartet (the title track of their album, &quot;What if Mozart Wrote &amp;#039;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&amp;#039;?&quot;), Jessica Simpson, Bif Naked, and Twisted Sister on their 2006 A Twisted Christmas album. Phil Spector recorded &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot; with the Ronettes. Comedian Kip Addotta recorded a parody called I Saw Daddy Kissing Santa Claus that gets played during Christmas time on the Dr. Demento radio show.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:284523f1d847b1570ca4e91c6d28d78580b123bb","amp;dn":"John+Cougar+Mellencamp+-+I+Saw+Mommy+Kissing+Santa+Claus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"284523f1d847b1570ca4e91c6d28d78580b123bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,69,35,241,216,71,177,87,12,164,233,28,109,40,215,133,128,177,35,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
