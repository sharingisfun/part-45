This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nWe hear about the first song ever to hit number one using rap, and the rapper was a woman.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;How many songs have predicted how high they will go in their titles?&quot; (Such as &quot;One Of These Nights&quot; by the Eagles hit number one, and &quot;#9 Dream&quot; by John Lennon hit number 9.) Casey lists twelve.\n\nCasey tells about the woman who holds the record between first chart appearance, and finally reaching number one (24 years). She's in the countdown.\n\nBruce Willis (Moonlighting/Die Hard) has a song in the countdown.\n\nCasey plays a piece of the first hit song to ever come from a motion picture, from 1927!\n\nOne woman in the countdown set a new record on the soul chart by having her fourth number one hit from the same album.\n \nLW#1: JacobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ladder Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Huey Lewis &amp; The News\n40:    I Will Be There Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Glass Tiger\n39:    WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Going On Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Cyndi Lauper\n38:    Light Of Day Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Barbusters (Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts)        \n37:    (I Just) Died In Your Arms Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Cutting Crew     \n36:    Smoking Gun Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Robert Cray Band     \n35:    Looking For A New Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jody Whatley    \n34:    Come As You Are Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Peter Wolf\n33:    Dominoes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Robbie Nevil\n32:    Stone Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kool &amp; The Gang\nLDD: Things Can Only Get Better Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Howard Jones\n31:    The Honeythief - Hipsway\n30:    IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Be Alright Without You - Journey\n29:    Will You Still Love Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Chicago\n28:    Keep Your Hands To Yourself Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Georgia Satellites\n27:    Walking Down Your Street Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Bangles\n26:    The Finer Things Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Steve Winwood\nEXTRA: Rapture - Blondie\n25:    As We Lay Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Shirley Murdock\n24:    Sign Ã¢â‚¬ËœOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ The Times - Prince\n23:    That AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Reo Speedwagon\n22:    What You Get Is What You See Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tina Turner\n21:    Candy - Cameo\n20:    I Wanna Go Back Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Eddie Money\n19:    Midnight Blue Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lou Gramm\n18:    Brand New Lover Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dead Or Alive\n17:    I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Aretha Franklin &amp; George Michael\n16:    LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Go!
