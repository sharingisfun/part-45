Web Designer gives you total design freedom Ã¢â‚¬â€œ using drag and drop you can literally place anything, anywhere on the page. And things which are normally difficult to achieve in HTML are a snap in Web Designer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for example text with curved edges, text or graphics at an angle, text flowing around objects Ã¢â‚¬â€œ no problem! Working with industry standards is vital, so Web Designer sites are W3C compliant, cross browser compatible (IE 5.5, Firefox, Safari, Chrome) and XHTML, CSS standards based. It can also import a huge range of files types for vector graphics, image and text including PDF, RTF, RAW, PSD, TIFF and of course JPEG, PNG, GIF. Whether you customize one of the bundled templates or create your own graphics or animations, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genuinely WYSIWYG Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what you see in Web Designer is exactly what you get on your website.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.xara.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.xara.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f088a092127d78f9e748ec716f69dd081fc13c8","amp;dn":"Xara+Web+Designer+MX+Premium+8.0.0.21461","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f088a092127d78f9e748ec716f69dd081fc13c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,8,138,9,33,39,215,143,158,116,142,199,22,246,157,208,129,252,19,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
