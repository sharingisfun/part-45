Guarisco    allmusic.com\nAlthough countless Mud compilations have been released over the years, none of them managed to cover every phase of the group's career. This was remedied in 1997 with the release of The Singles '67-'78. This overwhelmingly generous collection spans two discs and includes the A- and B-sides of each single the group released. Of course, the most impressive tracks are the hits from the group's stint at RAK Records: the combination of pop hooks and guitar firepower utilized for stomping glam classics like &quot;Tiger Feet&quot; and &quot;Dynamite&quot; still sound fresh and exciting today. However, this set also unearths some surprisingly good tracks from the group's oft-overlooked periods at Private Stock and RCA Records: &quot;L'L'Lucy&quot; is a full-throttle rock tune built on a smile-inducing vocal stutter hook and the languid yet catchy &quot;Slow Talking Boy&quot; is unlike anything else in the Mud catalog. Unfortunately, this generous array of material means the listener has to sit through more than one dud along the way, like the pleasant but inconsequential covers of &quot;Lean on Me&quot; and &quot;Drift Away.&quot; Even hardcore Mud fans may be tempted to scan through filler tracks like these. That said, The Singles '67-'78 remains the definitive way for any glam fan to explore the full history of this underrated group and it further enhances its value with a nice set of liner notes that include track-by-track commentary from lead vocalist Les Gray. Casual listeners will probably be better off with a single-disc compilation, but The Singles '67-'78 is the collection of choice for Mud enthusiasts. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_(band)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_(band)&lt;/a&gt;\nMud were an English glam rock band, formed in 1968, best remembered for their single &quot;Tiger Feet&quot; which was the UK's best-selling single of 1974. After joining RAK and teaming up with writers / producers Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, this good-time British band had a noteworthy run of hits, including three number ones.\n\nHistory\nMud first appeared on the Basil Brush show on BBC TV, and toured as support for Jack Jones. After years of unsuccessful singles, they were signed to Mickie Most's RAK label, and immediately had a Top 20 success with &quot;Crazy&quot;.\n\nAt the peak of their career they also enjoyed British number one singles with &quot;Tiger Feet&quot;; and &quot;Lonely This Christmas&quot; (1974), an affectionate Elvis Presley pastiche; plus &quot;Oh Boy&quot; (1975), a virtual a cappella cover of the Buddy Holly hit. &quot;Tiger Feet&quot; sold over 500,000 copies in the UK alone, and amassed a million sales globally.\n\nLike contemporaries Sweet, their most successful period came when their records were written and produced by Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, and in 1975 they had no fewer than seven singles on the UK Top 40. &quot;Oh Boy&quot; was the only number one single produced by Chinn and Chapman that they did not also write.\n\n&quot;Lonely This Christmas&quot; has become something of an annual fixture on British radio and television, (along with Slade's &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; and John Lennon's &quot;Happy Xmas&quot;). Mud also released another single under a different name - after &quot;The Cat Crept In&quot; they released a track from their album Mud Rock, a cover of &quot;In the Mood&quot;. This was released under the name of Dum (Mud spelt backwards), but failed to chart. Their last single was &quot;Rico&quot; released in 1980.\n\nThe last performance by the four original members was on 3 March 1990 at Dave Mount's wedding, a video recording of which was made by Mount.\n\nGray later toured as Les Gray's Mud in various line-ups, initially with members of the Bristol based Cherie Beck Band, later with Tim Fish (guitar), Mark Hatwood (Drums) and Kevin Fairburn (Bass), and ultimately with John Berry (bass), Syd Twynham (guitar) and Phil Wilson (drums). Twyham and Wilson still tour the 1970s circuit with Chris Savage (keyboards) and Marc Michalski (bass) as 'Mud II'.\n\nRay Stiles joined the Hollies; whilst Davis went on to co-write several highly successful dance hits for artists such as Kylie Minogue and Spiller featuring Sophie Ellis Bextor. Drummer Dave Mount went into the insurance business.\n\nLes Gray died on 21 February 2004 in Portugal, of a heart attack, as a result of throat cancer. \n\nLineup:\nLead guitarist Rob Davis (born Robert Davis, 1 October 1947, Carshalton, Surrey)\nLead vocalist Les Gray (born Thomas Leslie Gray, 9 April 1946, Carshalton, Surrey.
