Buckcherry's sophomore album is everything its eponymous debut was and more. It's an uncompromising melange of metal riffs via Aerosmith and ...    Full DescriptionAC/DC, punk tempos, the occasional blues-rock influence such as the Black Crowes-like &quot;Porno Star&quot; and the plaintive, almost Stones-ish &quot;Underneath,&quot; and the classic snot-nosed rock &amp; roll attitude of early Guns N' Roses.\n\nIt's bracing stuff--guitarists Keith Nelson and the charmingly monikered Yogi sound like they learned how to play by eating pieces of Angus Young--and it's often very funny in a deliberately over the top way. (Inspirational verse from the title song: &quot;Life ain't nothing but bitches and money.&quot;) TIME BOMB is a non-stop blast, and if the band's name isn't an anagram for a certain legendary '50s rocker, it should be.\n\nParental Advisory\n\nRecorded at Sunset Sounds, Hollywood, California.\n\nEngineers: Geoff Walcha, Patrick Thrasher, James McCrone.\n\nBuckcherry: Josh Todd (vocals); Keith Nelson (acoustic &amp; electric guitars, sitar); Yogi (guitar, mandolin, keyboards); Jonathan &quot;JB&quot; Brightman (bass); Devon Glenn (drums).\n\nAdditional personnel: Jamie Muhoberac (keyboards); Gia Ciambotti (background vocals).\n\n1.
