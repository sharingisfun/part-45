Its aim is to take you from an intermediate user with a basic understanding of SolidWorks and modeling techniques to an advanced user capable of creating complex models and able to use the advanced tools provided by SolidWorks. The text covers parts, surfaces, SimulationXpress, sheet metal, top-down assemblies and core and cavity molds.\n\nEvery lesson and exercise in this book was created based on real world projects. Each of these projects have been broken down and developed into easy and comprehensible steps for the reader. Furthermore, at the end of every chapter there are self test questionnaires to ensure that the reader has gained sufficient knowledge from each section before moving on to more advanced lessons. This book takes the approach that in order to understand SolidWorks, inside and out, the reader should create everything from the beginning and take it step by step.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAdvanced Modeling Topics\n1. 3D Sketch\n2.
