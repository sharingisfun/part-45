The Colonel argues with his family and locks himself in his study. Next morning, the door is still locked, but he is found dead. The house is cut off by snow, so it could only be one of the people in the house, all of whom have both motive and particular talents.\n\nIt sounds corny, but the plot twists and turns - including another murder - until the unexpected climax.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a438b386fe11651b8d1859930bd81a6157f97668","amp;dn":"A+Decent+British+Murder.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a438b386fe11651b8d1859930bd81a6157f97668","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,56,179,134,254,17,101,27,141,24,89,147,11,216,26,97,87,249,118,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
