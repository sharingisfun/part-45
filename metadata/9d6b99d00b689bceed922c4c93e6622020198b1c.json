We also hear what Jesse Ventura has to say about Ebola, learn about a Brooklyn teacher facing 36 counts of kidnapping and criminal sex against minors, a teacher from Louisiana arrested for allegedly having a sexual relationship with a student, and then the glorious callers chime in. Ant tells us about a woman suing a sperm bank for being inseminated by a black donor, he pitches us a charitable idea called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Feels For Meals,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ we are introduced to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Japanese Bobo,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ watch a Japanese game show, and we see Ã¢â‚¬Å“tough girlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and never want to see it again. The show ends with us enduring a call from Lady Trucker and Lady Di, talking about rapey porn, and chatting about message boards.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d6b99d00b689bceed922c4c93e6622020198b1c","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-10-01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d6b99d00b689bceed922c4c93e6622020198b1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,107,153,208,11,104,155,206,237,146,44,76,147,230,98,32,32,25,139,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
