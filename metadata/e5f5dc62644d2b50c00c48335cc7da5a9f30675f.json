With its intuitive yet powerful user interface, iPartition makes it easy to create, destroy, resize or format partitions on your hard disks, whether internal, external, fixed or removable.\n\nWith iPartition, resizing a partition is as simple as selecting it, grabbing the resize handle and dragging. Not only that, but if you have several operations to perform, iPartition lets you queue them up and run them one after another, so you can have a cup of coffee while iPartition works. This feature, coupled with iPartitionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ability to automatically rearrange your existing partitions when necessary, makes iPartition the easiest partitioning tool that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll ever use.\n\n\nFull support for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion\niPartition is fully compatible with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, and with the very latest hardware from Apple.\n\nRepartition without reformatting\n\nWant to change the size of a partition thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s currently full of data? iPartition supports non-destructive resize of HFS+ (including case-sensitive and journaled), FAT and NTFS partitions.\n\nWorks with Boot Camp\n\nYou can use iPartition on drives that contain Boot Camp volumes; in fact, you can even resize your Windows partitions, and let iPartition take care of reconfiguring the Windows boot process for you.\n\nSupport for case-sensitive HFS+\n\nUsing case-sensitive HFS+ for compatibility with legacy UNIX software? No problem. iPartition can even convert case-sensitive HFS+ to normal HFS+ and vice-versa, a real boon if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve made the wrong choice in the past.\n\nSupports PC disks too\n\niPartition has always had support for Apple Partition Maps, and when the Intel Macs were released we added support for the new GUID Partition Tables too. With iPartition 3, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve added support for PC partition tables, so you can use iPartition for your PC disks also.\n\nConvert disks from Mac to PC (orÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â viceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Ëœversa) \n\nEven better, if you have a disk you partitioned for use with a Mac, and want to access it from a PCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or maybe you bought an external drive pre-formatted for use with a PC and now want to boot your Mac from itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½iPartition can convert the partition tables for you, keeping all your data intact.\n\nBuilt-in intelligence makes partitioning easier\n\nUnlike other partitioning utilities, iPartition is smart. Its built-in intelligence automatically minimizes the number of operations it must perform and the amount of data it must move, streamlining the partitioning process and saving you precious time.\n\nPower cut during partitioning? No problem.\nWhile we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t recommend that you rely on it, iPartition can normally recover your disk even if you pull the plug during repartitioning.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac, OS X.6 or greater\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5f5dc62644d2b50c00c48335cc7da5a9f30675f","amp;dn":"iPartition+v.+3.3.1+%28172%29+with+%5BK%5Drack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5f5dc62644d2b50c00c48335cc7da5a9f30675f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,245,220,98,100,77,43,80,192,12,72,51,92,199,218,90,159,48,103,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
