Hairul Azreen as Afiq is a youth who comes from a wealthy family and is interested in only motorcycle races and dance. Meanwhile, Faralyna Idris as Lisa is a poor village girl who mostly keeps to herself. Fizz Fairuz plays Haikal, LisaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strict brother who tries to control LisaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conversations and acquaintances. In college, Afiq falls for Lisa, but Lisa misunderstands Afiq behaviour because of their closeness, as she is also ErnaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend. Kris, who is interested in Erna, is jealous of Erna and AfiqÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friendship, which leads to a rivalry between the two.\n\nAudio : Malay\nSubtitles : None\nResolution : 400p\nSaiz : 350Mb\nEncoder : ZoRRo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2c9f6f85b536dd2b63c7c262e227bb5c0c00260","amp;dn":"Gila-gila+Remaja+II+2013+PPVrip.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2c9f6f85b536dd2b63c7c262e227bb5c0c00260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,201,246,248,91,83,109,210,182,60,124,38,46,34,123,181,192,192,2,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
