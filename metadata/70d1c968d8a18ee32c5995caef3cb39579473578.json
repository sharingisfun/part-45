Make sure you have got at LEAST an Apple sticker to put on your Aspire One\nOr if not, go and BUY leopard off Apple and then proceed.\nAt least to properly license it. Which is what the apple sticker is.\n\nYou dont require this for installation but i reccomend it.\n\nBurn this ISO with your favourite image burner such as Nero, \nPowerISO or MagicISO\n\nCRucIAL: BACK UP ANY IMPORTANT DATA BEFORE PROCEEDING\n\nMake sure you have an external USB DVD-RW Drive, i got mine for Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£15 at PC World\n\nNext, we need to hit F12 at the Acer splash screen and choose you ATAPI DVD Drive.\n\nThen when Darwin displays, hit F8 and type -v cpus=1\n\nMost OS's see my Intel Atom as dual core, and OSX86 won' t handle it properly\nunless you have Kalyway with Vanilla kernal.\n\nI found KalyWay too problematic.\n\nWhen OS X starts up, you need to go onto the Disk Utility in the taskbar.\n\nTHINK BACK AND CHECK YOUR FILES ARE SAFELY BACKED UP.\n\nThen you need to click your partition you are choosing to format.\n\nMake sure you select Macintosh Extended (Journaled)\n\nThen click Erase.\n\nExit the disk utility and proceed to Install.\n\nMake sure to tick the Intel GMA 950 driver in the Custom install option.\nAnd browse through for a compatable PS/2 driver for the keyboard.\n\nThen once it is installed, it will restart...Now hit F8 and type CPUS=1 and press Enter.\n\nYou will need to type this every time until i find a fix. \n\nThe Apple splash logo will appear, and after a short period you can register your new macbookmini :D\n\nOnce installed you will want the double tap on your touchpad right...?\n\nTo fix this go into System Preferences and choose Mouse.\n\nThen browse through until you find the touchpad option area and tick the double tap box.\n\nTapping will now work.\n\nTo get the Audio and the Ethernet, just follow the steps provided in my other Readme.\n\nYOU WILL NOT GET WI-FI FROM THE DEFAULT WI-FI CARD!!! (You will need to replace the default card - google it)\n\nEnjoy leopard on your Aspire One :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70d1c968d8a18ee32c5995caef3cb39579473578","amp;dn":"OSX86+For+Acer+Aspire+One","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70d1c968d8a18ee32c5995caef3cb39579473578","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,209,201,104,216,161,142,227,44,89,149,202,239,60,179,149,121,71,53,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
