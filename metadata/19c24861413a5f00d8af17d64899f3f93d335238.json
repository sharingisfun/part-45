But the war unfolded in color. And that&amp;#039;s how Academy Award-winning director George Stevens (A Place in the Sun, Giant) captured it in this acclaimed compilation of the personal wartime diary he filmed while on the front life. George Stevens, Jr. produces and narrates this triple Emmy-winning look at the world at war.
