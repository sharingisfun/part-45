Has a lot of his original recordings of older tracks. Great album for any Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer or Lee Scratch Perry fans out there. \n\nThe versions featured here find Marley and band midway between their '60s incarnation as an Impressions- and Temptations-influenced vocal group and their '70s emergence as international ambassadors of Rastafarianism\n\n.\t1.
