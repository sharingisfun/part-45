Reclaim one building at a time and put your survivors to work scavenging for food, building houses, rediscovering technology and of course killing zombies.\nBeware of rival gangs, illness, thieves and even riots as you rebuild a city in this post apocalyptic turn based strategy game.\n\nFEATURES\n- Unique turn-based strategy gameplay \n- Randomly generated cities \n- Customizable characters \n- 5 levels of difficulty \n- 7 endings to discover\n\nVersion 1.21 Bugfixes, added new compatible devices, but made some older phones incompatible (sorry to HTC Desire users).\nIf you get crashes/white screens try moving to SD card and rebooting your device. Sticky Broadcasts are required by Adobe AIR but not used in my code.\nEnglish only.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6acf3be0f02594439bcee54e144c73c20a87d303","amp;dn":"Rebuild+v1.21+Android+%28working%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6acf3be0f02594439bcee54e144c73c20a87d303","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,207,59,224,240,37,148,67,155,206,229,78,20,76,115,194,10,135,211,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
