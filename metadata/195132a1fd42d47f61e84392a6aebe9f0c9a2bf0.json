However, St. Holmes did sing on the tracks &quot;Turn It Up,&quot; &quot;Light My Way,&quot; &quot;Dog Eat Dog,&quot; and an alternate version of &quot;Street Rats&quot;, which was cut from the album and ultimately released on the 1993 Epic/Legacy compilation album, Out of Control. St. Holmes returned to the group after Free For All was released, performing on the subsequent tour. Vocalist Meat Loaf, then an unknown, was brought in to sing on some of the album's tracks that were meant for St. Holmes: &quot;Writing on the Wall,&quot; &quot;Street Rats,&quot; &quot;Together,&quot; &quot;Hammerdown,&quot; and &quot;I Love You So I Told You a Lie.&quot;\n\nFLAC\n\nTed Nugent\n\nFree-For-All (1999 remaster)\n\n1976\n\nCD - No artwork\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Free-for-All&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:20\n&quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:04\n&quot;Writing on the Wall&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:08\n&quot;Turn It Up&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:36\n&quot;Street Rats&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:36\n&quot;Together&quot; (Rob Grange, Cliff Davies) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:52\n&quot;Light My Way&quot; (Derek St. Holmes, Rob Grange) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:00\n&quot;Hammerdown&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:07\n&quot;I Love You So I Told You a Lie&quot; (Cliff Davies) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:47\n&quot;Free-for-All&quot; (live) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:13\n&quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; (live) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:21\n&quot;Street Rats&quot; (alternate version with Derek St. Holmes on vocals) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:195132a1fd42d47f61e84392a6aebe9f0c9a2bf0","amp;dn":"Ted+Nugent+-+Free-For-All+%281976%2FRemastered%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"195132a1fd42d47f61e84392a6aebe9f0c9a2bf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,81,50,161,253,66,212,127,97,232,67,146,166,174,190,159,12,154,43,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
