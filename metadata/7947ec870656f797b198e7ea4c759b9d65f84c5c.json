As Faulques struggles to recall the face, the man explains that he was the subject of an iconic photo taken by Faulques in a war zone years agoÃ¢â‚¬â€œa photo that destroyed his life. Ã¢â‚¬Å“And why have you come looking for me?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ asks Faulques. The stranger answers, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Because IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to kill you.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSo begins a life-or-death exchange in which Faulques is forced to recall a time when he loved a beautiful woman and risked his life daily for art and testimony. Yet as the tense dialogue between Faulques and his would-be killer continues, the stakes grow even higher. What they are grappling with becomes not just FaulquesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fate, but the very nature of love and cruelty itself.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the nearest IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got to a personal memoir,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ explains best-selling Spanish author Arturo PÃƒÂ©rez-Reverte, who drew extensively on his experience as a war correspondent while writing The Painter of Battles.
