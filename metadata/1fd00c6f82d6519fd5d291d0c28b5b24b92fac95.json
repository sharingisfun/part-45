Can it be true? Has goodness taken hold of the world's greatest teenage criminal mastermind? Captain Holly Short is unconvinced, and discovers that Artemis is suffering from Atlantis Complex, a psychosis common among guilt-ridden fairies - not humans - and most likely triggered by Artemis's dabbling with fairy magic. Symptoms include obsessive-compulsive behavior, paranoia, multiple personality disorder and, in extreme cases, embarrassing professions of love to a certain feisty LEPrecon fairy. Unfortunately, Atlantis Complex has struck at the worst possible time. A deadly foe from Holly's past is intent on destroying the actual city of Atlantis. Can Artemis escape the confines of his mind - and the grips of a giant squid - in time to save the underwater metropolis and its fairy inhabitants?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fd00c6f82d6519fd5d291d0c28b5b24b92fac95","amp;dn":"Atlantis+Complex%2C+The+%28Artemis+Fowl%2C+Book+7%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fd00c6f82d6519fd5d291d0c28b5b24b92fac95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,208,12,111,130,214,81,159,213,210,145,208,194,139,91,36,185,47,172,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
