Gloria Grahame, at her brassiest, pleads with Glenn Ford to do away with her slob of a husband, Broderick Crawford. Lang mines the railroad setting for a remarkably rich series of visual correlatives to his oppressively Catholic conception of guilt and retribution. A gripping Noir.\n\nLang's version of Zola's La BÃƒÂªte Humaine is, like all his best '50s work, as cold, hard and steely grey as the railway tracks which here mark out the action. Glenn Ford, the perfect embodiment of these qualities, returns from Korea, only to be pulled into the murderously destructive marriage between Grahame and Crawford (both superb). The bleak, dark marshalling yards are the perfect backdrop for the playing out of adulterous relationships where 'desire' signifies only fear, jealousy and hatred.\n\n2nd husband was the director Nicholas Ray,4th one was Anthony Ray the son of her second husband Nicholas Ray and her former stepson,and she had children by both.\n\nWhen railway worker Carl Buckley is fired by his foreman, he compels his seductive wife Vicki to ask Mr Owens, a senior railway official, to have him reinstated. When Vicki manages to get him his job back, Buckley is immediately suspicious that she may have allowed Owens to seduce her, Consumed with jealousy, Buckley stabs Owens to death during a train journey and uses a letter from his wife to the dead man to ensure she does not testify against him. On the night of the killing, Korean war veteran Jeff Warren sees Vicki leaving the compartment in which the murder takes place. Jeff finds himself irresistibly drawn towards Vicki and does not mention what he has seen at the inquest into the killing. Later, once they have embarked on a passionate love affair, Vicki reveals the danger she is in and persuades Jeff that he must kill her husband...\n\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 849mb\nDuration.... 01:30:51\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width..... 718\nFrame Height.... 460\nData Rate.... 1180kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 122kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48 KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:481541393388deb2d99b8b2710895fbb5704913a","amp;dn":"Human+Desire+1954+DvdRip+Mp4+Le1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"481541393388deb2d99b8b2710895fbb5704913a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,21,65,57,51,136,222,178,217,155,139,39,16,137,95,187,87,4,145,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
