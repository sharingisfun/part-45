It is an in-depth examination of what the English monarchy has meant, in terms of the expression of the individual, the Mother of Parliaments, Magna Carta, the laws of England and the land of England.\n\nIn this series Dr David Starkey, Britain's most eminent living historian and presenter brings to life powerful individuals with colourful characters using his unique and engaging gift as a communicator. The importance of the rich heritage of the Anglo-Saxon kings is underlined, and among the kings most heavily featured are: Alfred the Great, Canute, Edward the Confessor, William the Conqueror, Henry II, Richard Lionheart, Henry III and Henry VI. \n\n\n\n7. The Crown Imperial:\n\n1450s and The Wars of the Roses, leading to the birth of the Tudors.\n\n\n8. King and Emperor:\n\nThe reign of Henry VIII; his divorce and resulting dissociation with Rome, which led to the Dissolution of the Monasteries.\n\n\n9. The Shadow of the King:\n\nFollowing the death of Henry VIII and the Act of Succession of 1543, which allowed all three of his children to rule. Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I followed in their father's footsteps.\n\n\n10. The Stuart Succession:\n\nWith the defeat of the Spanish Armada, the English royalty was at its zenith. Scotland and England became united under the Stuart King James I (VI of Scotland), but his son Charles I within a generation would throw the country into civil war.\n\n\n11.
