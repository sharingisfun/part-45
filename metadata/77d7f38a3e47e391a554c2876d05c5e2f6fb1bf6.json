In three dreadful years over one third of Europe's population was wiped out.\n\nEveryone believed it heralded the end of the world. To the chroniclers of Padua the plague was devastation deemed more final than Noah's flood. The plague shook the wealthy, relatively well-populated society of mid-14th-century Western Europe to its foundations. Black Death follows the spread of the plague and its implications for the Europe of the Middle Ages.\n\nLooking at issues such as medicine, religion, superstition and society, and employing expert analysis from top historians, this is a look at one of the most chilling and terrible periods in all of human existence. Most of all, this is history told through contemporary voices of some of the key chroniclers of the time. Real people who contracted the disease and died from it left amazing, vivid accounts of what it feels like to live in a world that is falling apart.\n\nCast:\nGabriele de Musis - Simon Thorp\nGiovanni Boccaccio - Vincent Carmichael\nGentile da Foligno - Philip Madoc\nLouis Heyligen - Jonathan Firth\nRobert of Avesbury - Patrick Toomey\nGui de Chauliac - Nicholas Rowe\nBailiff of the Court - Timothy Watson\nNicholas Deneys - Dorian Lough\nLady Rose de Saxham - Susan Engel\nBrother John Clynn - Mark Tandy\n\n\nNarrator Denis Lawson\nProducer and Director Peter Nicholson","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77d7f38a3e47e391a554c2876d05c5e2f6fb1bf6","amp;dn":"The+Black+Death++%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77d7f38a3e47e391a554c2876d05c5e2f6fb1bf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,215,243,138,62,71,227,145,165,84,194,135,109,5,197,226,246,251,27,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
