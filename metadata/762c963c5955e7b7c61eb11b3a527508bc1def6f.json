What if you could change it back? Stephen KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heart-stoppingly dramatic new novel is about a man who travels back in time to prevent the JFK assassinationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a thousand page tour de force.\n\nFollowing his massively successful novel Under the Dome, King sweeps readers back in time to another momentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a real life momentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½when everything went wrong: the JFK assassination. And he introduces readers to a character who has the power to change the course of history.\n\n\nJake Epping is a thirty-five-year-old high school English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching adults in the GED program. He receives an essay from one of the studentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a gruesome, harrowing first person story about the night 50 years ago when Harry DunningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a hammer. Harry escaped with a smashed leg, as evidenced by his crooked walk.\n\nNot much later, JakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s friend Al, who runs the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to 1958. He enlists Jake on an insaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and insanely possibleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½mission to try to prevent the Kennedy assassination. So begins JakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new life as George Amberson and his new world of Elvis and JFK, of big American cars and sock hops, of a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and a beautiful high school librarian named Sadie Dunhill, who becomes the love of JakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a life that transgresses all the normal rules of time.\n\nA tribute to a simpler era and a devastating exercise in escalating suspense, 11/22/63 is Stephen King at his epic best.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:762c963c5955e7b7c61eb11b3a527508bc1def6f","amp;dn":"11%2F22%2F63%3A+A+Novel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"762c963c5955e7b7c61eb11b3a527508bc1def6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,44,150,60,89,85,231,183,198,30,177,27,58,82,117,8,188,29,239,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
