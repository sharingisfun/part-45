The RAM disk appears like a physical hard disk to the operating system and programs. You choose its size (depending on the amount of RAM in your system), drive letter, and file system. You can copy, move and delete files on it. Like a physical disk, a RAM disk can also be shared so as to be accessed by other computers on a network.\n\tXP 32 &amp; 64-bit Certified\n  \t  \tThe most important difference between a RAM disk and a hard disk is access speed. The time taken for a hard disk to move its magnetic heads over the spinning disks (much like the arm moving over old vinyl record player) is typically measured in milliseconds (thousandths of a second). Whereas a RAM disk does not have mechanical parts and its access speed is typically measured in nanoseconds (billionths of a second). Access to a RAM disk may be 50 times faster or more than to a hard drive.\n  \t  \tRamDisk supports a single RAM disk with no backup capability.\nRamDisk Plus Features: \t  \tRamDisk Plus adds multiple disk support, system page file support, and a versatile disk image backup and restore facility. You can manually save the RAM diskÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s contents to an image file, or have the contents saved automatically when the computer is shutdown. This feature ensures that service and application data stored on the RAM disk can be preserved between system restarts. During the subsequent system start-up, the disk&amp;#039;s image is automatically loaded. A &quot;live&quot; RAM disk image may be backed up even with open handles to the volume. A RAM disk viewer lets you load image files as read-only devices.\nExtended memory access \t  \t\n\nRamDisk Plus 9 has a most unique feature. Our patent pending technology can access memory beyond the limitation imposed by a Windows 32-bit operating system! In other words, RamDisk Plus 9 can use &quot;unmanaged&quot; Windows&amp;#039; memory e.g. above 4GB. It can also use the stubbornly inaccessable memory between 3.2GB and 4GB.\n\nSee the product&amp;#039;s help file for detailed explanation of what &quot;unmanaged&quot; memory is and how to access and use it with RamDisk Plus 9.\n\n\nDisk types \t  \t\n\nVirtual and removable disk types are also supported. Disks can be created with partition tables or without. RamDisk 9.0 and RamDisk Plus 9.0 can create partitionable RAM disks, which are supported by Volume Managment software. Windows&amp;#039; MMC disk managment snap-in recognizes and manages partitionable RAM disks. They are also compatible with other software such as Partition Magic and Veritas Volume Manager. RamDisk Plus 9.0 also can create and configure non-partitionable RAM disks, which are compatible with RAM disks created by RamDisk and RamDisk Plus version 8.0. RAM disks can be zeroed out upon removal and the disk image file can be preserved upon removal. A new licensing mechanism binds the software to the machine name rather than a system ID. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.superspeed.com/desktop/ramdisk.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.superspeed.com/desktop/ramdisk.php&lt;/a&gt; - For More Info\n\nInsert The Serial Key While Installing  \n\nThanks For Downloading.....SEED And Enjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e617b92db88fd1bb6013b84c11bf915b7b28ae6","amp;dn":"RamDisk+9+PLUS+With+Serial+-+%5Bkn0wnunkn0wn%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e617b92db88fd1bb6013b84c11bf915b7b28ae6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,97,123,146,219,136,253,27,182,1,59,132,193,27,249,21,183,178,138,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
