You don't write songs like this and not expect to get noticed. Pneuma truly grew from word-of-mouth and grassroots beginnings. This is not a request, drop whatever you're listening to right now. Moving Mountains is better.&quot; | Absolutepunk.net\n\n&quot;When the band dip into their most experimental, dynamic and emotional elements, a comparison could be made to any punk-turned-epic-brooder of the last five years (Brand New, Thrice) and the band's extolled peers (This Will Destroy you, Chin Up Chin Up)- an interesting place to be, for sure. Pneuma is an incredibly promising debut.&quot; | Alternative Press\n\n&quot;What Moving Mountains are so adept at on Pneuma are bridging musical gaps. Moving Mountains have created a completely modern record that is still obviously indebted to its past. Pneuma is quite simply a stunning collision of post-rock and emo the likes rarely seen.&quot; | Sound As Language\n\n&quot;Amalgamation. Expansive. Juxtaposition. Tryst. Myriad. These are just a few words that are often used by critics to describe artists that can effectively flex themselves across a wide range of musical ideas. With arguably so much more mixing, criss-crossing and experimentation going on than ever before, it seems almost as if a new style or sub-genre of rock is invented daily. Enter Moving Mountains.&quot; | Decoy Music","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1715c464f3c4d8fd327c662e1d136731d69f8e9d","amp;dn":"Moving+Mountains+-+Foreword+%5B2009+Advance%5D+192Kbps+SANTOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1715c464f3c4d8fd327c662e1d136731d69f8e9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,21,196,100,243,196,216,253,50,124,102,46,29,19,103,49,214,159,142,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
