Literally, it's not a positive image. Death to me seemed to be terrifying. Since I know that I was created and assigned by the Lord of the world, I now clearly realize that the earth is only a temporary place to dwell in. The eternal home is in heaven. The most important thing on earth is to prepare myself and form my characteristics for the eternal task in heaven. Friends, hope you will receive this salvation soon before it's too late. I did this song for practicing my arranging skills. \n\n[Verse 1]\nHere I am \nWith the sorrow I came\nRoses, letters, and tears\nShalom, farewell, my friend\n\nThere I saw the winter snow thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s falling from the sky\nFrom mountain high and valley low\nCovered in the white\n\n[Channel 1]\nWhite out every story made of memory\nMelt into the river flows with out a trace\n\n[Chorus]\nFalling, falling.\nFalling down as white as snow\nThe snow, the everlasting cold\nFrom the sky, the snow of sorrow falls\nFalling down as cold as snow\nThe snow, the everlasting cold\nOn your face, the face of beauty shows\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere you lie\nWith a smile like a child\nEyebrows, lips, and your cheeks\nPeaceful, quite, your soul\n\nThere I saw the winter snow, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s melting from the hills\nThe risen sun, the fallen stars\nTaking you away\n\n[Channel 2]\nTake you out of here, and out of memory\nAnd the story of ours made it to the end\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\nFalling, falling.\nFalling down as white as snow\nThe snow, the everlasting cold\nFrom the sky, the snow of sorrow falls\nFalling down as cold as snow\nThe snow, the everlasting cold\nOn your face, the face of beauty shows\n\n[Chorus]\nFalling down as white as snow \nThe snow, the everlasting cold\nFrom the sky, the snow of sorrow falls\nFalling down as cold as snow\nThe snow, the everlasting cold\nOn your face, the face of beauty shows\n\n[Bridge]\nFalling snow\nFalls on you\nRiver flows\nFlows away\nFalling snow, oh falling snow\nThe snow as white as cold as you\n\n[Chorus]\nFalling down as white as snow\nThe snow, the everlasting cold\nFrom the sky, the snow of sorrow falls\nFalling down as cold as snow\nThe snow, the everlasting cold\nOn your face, the face of beauty shows","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0e4e3f98998a7401e906947f3b03147652d5a29","amp;dn":"Jack+Kao+-+Falling+snow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0e4e3f98998a7401e906947f3b03147652d5a29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,228,227,249,137,152,167,64,30,144,105,71,243,176,49,71,101,45,90,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
