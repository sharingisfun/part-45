You will learn how to take advantage of the new \nbitmap features in Flash Professional 8, such as filters and blend modes. The tutorials will also show you how to \ncontrol the optimization settings in Flash for bitmap images when they are embedded inside exported SWF files, \nand how to load external bitmaps into Flash movies.\n\nTable of contents\nIntroductionWelcome \t1:02\t1.1 MB\n\n1.
