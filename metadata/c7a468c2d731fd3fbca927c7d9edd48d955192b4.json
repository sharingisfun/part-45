Hauk's enemies are legion, but he fears nothing and no one. He will do whatever it takes to survive and protect his Sentella brethren.\n\nSumi Antaxas is one of the best assassins the League has ever trained. In her world, failure is not an option and she has never met a target she couldn't execute. So when she's assigned Hauk, she believes it'll be a quick and easy mission.\n\nBut nothing is ever as simple as it seems, and Hauk is far better trained and skilled than his dossier shows. More than that, as she pursues him, she stumbles upon the key that will bring down not only Hauk, but the entire Sentella organization.\n\nIn the race to report her information, she is overtaken by enemies out to end her as effectively as she intends to end Hauk. Now her only key to survival is the one man she's been sent to kill. And Hauk doesn't trust her at all.\n\nThe only question is, will he help her to live... or send her to her grave.\n\n\nRise of the Gryphon - (Belador #4)\n\n\nIn the fourth novel of the bestselling Belador paranormal series, Evalle Kincaid must turn her back on the Beladors to protect those she loves, and the world, from annihilation.\nTo prevent a genocide, Evalle is forced to embrace her destinyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but at what cost?\n\nAs an Alterant who fights everything from trolls to demons, Evalle has lived as an outcast among the Beladors, but can now change all thatÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and find answers to her origins as well. Those answers and a traitor hide within the Medb coven, an enemy poised to destroy the mortal world and all that Evalle holds dear. While her best friends Tzader and Quinn want to help, they have their own conflicts and face unthinkable choices as relationships with the women they love twist in unexpected directions. With time ticking down on a decision that will compel allies to become deadly enemies, Evalle turns to Storm and takes a major step that only complicates matters more when the witchdoctor heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been hunting now stalks Evalle.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7a468c2d731fd3fbca927c7d9edd48d955192b4","amp;dn":"Sherrilyn+Kenyon++-+Born+of+Fury+%26amp%3B+Gryphon+%28Request%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7a468c2d731fd3fbca927c7d9edd48d955192b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,164,104,194,215,49,253,63,188,169,39,199,217,237,212,141,149,81,146,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
