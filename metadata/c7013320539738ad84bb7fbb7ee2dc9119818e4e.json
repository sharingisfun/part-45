I sort of had the impression that it was going to be their most commercial work yet.The first magnificent single Imitation Of Life had an instant appeal for me and I expected each subsquent album track to be the same.Well I was totally wrong.There are no other tracks with that sort of instant appeal-but give this c.d. a few listens and you discover tracks of great depth,songs that have an upbeat almost summer feel to them and yes their most accesible work in years.Yeah I think this album will be huge and the main reason for this is that there are no dud tracks,no over-indulgent experiments-just good quality songs that epitomised R.E.M.'s early work and that you'd get on 50% of the tracks on Monster,New Adventures... and Up! Track one starts this c.d. off in great style-the most immediate thing to notice is the use of swirling synths and Stipe sounding in great form.It's the sort of song that makes you think &quot;oh this is a return to what they do best&quot;.Track 2 is a really beautiful atmostpheric track-people have compared this to Massive Attack or Portishead.Once again there is very little guitar here-synths and drum machines give this ballad a mininmalist feel .The guitar returns spectacularly in track 3-the riff dominates and sounds like deep country sounds.Lyrically it's quite funny-and vocally it's one of the albums highlights.So after 3 tracks you realise that this is going to be a great album.Track 4 starts off with an acousitc guitar and this song initially has a bit of a folk-ballad sound.Then the chorus kicks in and you get all sorts of Wurlitzer effects-it's one of these songs that really takes a while to grow before you realise how good it is.The contrast between the low key start to the instrumental section with full strings section is incredible.Track 5 Disappear with it's references to Tel Aviv and Agadir is really like something taken from Automatic ... without the multi-layered harmonies.\n\nSaturn Return is another amazing track.At first I thought it sounded very like Airportman from Up.Piano chords,feint guitar and a myriad of distorted background effects added to Stipe doing falsetto-it's a darker more atmostpheric track then the majority of songs on this c.d.Beat A Drum has a complete change of mood-it's a real summer song with nature seemingly painted in all it's glory-this song will cheer you up no matter what sort of day you've had.Then we have the amazing and most commercial song on the c.d. Imitation Of Life-my God what a chorus.It's got to be the best R.E.M. single in ten years.The summer feeling continues with the next song that has a real Beach Boy feel to it.\n\nThe summer feeling goes for the next song Chorus And The Ring-few keyboards on this song.It's mostly gentle electric guitar and sounds very like early R.E.M.The next song is a beautiful sentimental ballad,the chorus is a real sing along strong chorus and like most of the songs on this c.d. it's a pretty slow tempo song.The last song has once again got an upbeat feel to it,with certain Latino influences,a brass interlude and a full string compliment again.A great way to end this wonderful c.d.\n\nI've had this c.d. for nearly a week now and I haven't stopped listening to it.This is just a great c.d. and the best return to form of one of the best rock bands in the world. \n\nby Ian Creamer\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - The Lifting.wma                                         \n02 - I've Been High.wma                                     \n03 - All The Way To Reno (You're Gonna Be A Star).wma       \n04 - She Just Wants To Be.wma                               \n05 - Disappear.wma                                          \n06 - Saturn Return.wma                                      \n07 - Beat A Drum.wma                                        \n08 - Imitation Of Life.wma                                  \n09 - Summer Turns To High.wma                               \n10 - Chorus And The Ring.wma                                \n11 - I'll Take The Rain.wma                                 \n12 - Beachball.wma \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7013320539738ad84bb7fbb7ee2dc9119818e4e","amp;dn":"R.E.M.+-+Reveal+%282001%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7013320539738ad84bb7fbb7ee2dc9119818e4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,1,51,32,83,151,56,173,132,187,127,187,126,226,220,145,25,129,142,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
