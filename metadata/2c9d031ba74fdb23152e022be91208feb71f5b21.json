Then the credit crunch of August 2007 turned into the great crash of SeptemberÃ¢â‚¬â€œOctober 2008, leading one apologist for the system, Willem Buiter, to write of &quot;the end of capitalism as we knew it.&quot;\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, the world witnessed the way in which the runaway speculation of the &quot;shadow&quot; banking system wreaked havoc on world markets, leaving real human devastation in its wake. Faced with the financial crisis, some economic commentators began to talk of &quot;zombie banks&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€œfinancial institutions that were in an &quot;undead state&quot; and incapable of fulfilling any positive function but a threat to everything else. What they do not realize is that twenty-first century capitalism as a whole is a zombie system, seemingly dead when it comes to achieving human goals.
