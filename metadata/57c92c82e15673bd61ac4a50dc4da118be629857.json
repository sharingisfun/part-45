It benefited the Ronald McDonald House and The Starlight Foundation. No shows were aired on SaturdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so there are no episodes for days 7, 14 or 21. This series aired a few weeks after series 2 finished and was the only\ncelebrity version done in Australia.\n\nNow for the bad. The video in this series is not very good. Series 1 and 2 as well as this celeb version all have a few video issues but this series is the worst of the three. I have searched everywhere for a different copy of this series and have never \nfound one. To my knowledge this is the only copy of this series that exists. It's still worth watching.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57c92c82e15673bd61ac4a50dc4da118be629857","amp;dn":"Celebrity.Big.Brother.Australia.AU.Series.1+%28READ+INFO%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57c92c82e15673bd61ac4a50dc4da118be629857","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,201,44,130,225,86,115,189,97,172,74,80,220,77,161,24,190,98,152,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
