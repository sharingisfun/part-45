This book introduces ancient debates, engaging us with the ancient developments of their themes. Moving away from the presentation of ancient philosophy as a succession of great thinkers, the book gives readers a sense of the freshness and liveliness of ancient philosophy, and of its wide variety of themes and styles.\nAbout the Author\n\nJulia Annas is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Arizona and author of several books for OUP, including An Introduction to Platos Republic and The Morality of Happiness. She is also series editor for the Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy.\n\nMP3\n\nLAME VBR V6\n\nPHC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bffc4b9de7f109231ed385d274f0ec10f88051b","amp;dn":"Oxford-Ancient_Philosophy-A_Very_Short_Introduction-2001-AUDIOBO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bffc4b9de7f109231ed385d274f0ec10f88051b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,255,196,185,222,127,16,146,49,237,56,93,39,79,14,193,15,136,5,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
