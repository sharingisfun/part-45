If you love to dance, if you loved the music scene in the late 80s/early 90s, you MUST have this release in your collection. Layered, anthemic orchestrations coupled with awesome lyrics and vocals make this an easy download decision for anyone who has ever loved to get out on a dance floor. Musicians who also enjoy great pop/dance/Freestyle compositions will get a definite earful from this release and a lot of inspiration. And if you like &quot;Bad of the Heart&quot; and &quot;Without You,&quot; try to find the remix singles released back in 1989/1990.\n\nOne of my favorite freestyle albums - enjoy!\n\nTrack Listings\n1.
