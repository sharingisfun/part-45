Trouble is he owes his victory to a computer glitch in the national touch-screen voting system marketed by Delacroy, a private company with a rising stock price. To protect their fortune, Delacroy executives want to keep the glitch a secret, but one programmer, Eleanor Green, wants Dobbs to know the truth. Can she get to him?

When the presidential election approaches, he decides to become an independent candidate in order to gain more material and be able to mock the candidates up-close. To his, as well as a lot of peoples&amp;#039; surprise, he actually becomes elected to president. In reality, however, the whole thing was caused by a major glitch in the new electronic voting system that was used. The executives of the company that designed it, Delacroy, both want to keep the truth a secret, as it will mean the end of the company. One of its lead programmers, Eleanor Green, decides to tell the truth. The Delacroy executives become determined to stop her at all costs. Written by J.
