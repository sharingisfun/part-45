Their leader Anna (Morena Baccarin) offers to trade technology and cures for many diseases with mankind, in return for water and minerals. She invites TV journalist Chad Decker (Scott Wolf) to interview her, on the condition he only portray the Visitors in a positive light.\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation counterterrorism agent Erica Evans (Elizabeth Mitchell) disapproves that her teenage son Tyler (Logan Huffman) is so enamoured by the aliens, being recruited for the V Peace Ambassador Program by the beautiful Visitor Lisa (Laura Vandervoort). Erica and her partner Dale Maddox (Alan Tudyk) investigate a group of terrorists whose activity spiked during the Visitors' initial appearance. They discover an abandoned hideout containing explosives, fake IDs and a deceased man who was tortured prior to his death. His cellphone contains details of a sleeper cell meeting, which Erica attends.\n\nElsewhere, Catholic priest Jack Landry (Joel Gretsch) is suspicious of the Visitors, and warns his parishioners to be wary of them. He doubts his stance when a previously wheelchair-bound parishioner is able to walk again, but has his suspicions confirmed when a mortally wounded man arrives at the church, telling Jack he knows the real reason behind the Visitors' appearance on Earth, handing him a dossier on the aliens and details of a secret meeting.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1307824/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1307824/&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_%282009_TV_series%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_%282009_TV_series%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nBrought to you by\nB2B\n2Lions Team\n\nmeer zien??\nKom dan eens kijken op ons forum\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.2lions.ons-forum.nl/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.2lions.ons-forum.nl/index.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2Lions-Team for all your Dutch MOVIES and more\n\n*****************************************\n\nDON T HIT AND RUN Niet gelijk afhaken als de film binnen is blijf seeden.\n\nDon`t quit after you finished the download, but keep seeding.\n\t\n******************************************************\n\nThere are fake torrents from uploaders who use our team name.\nThose are not ours, or members from our team.\nWe 2Lions-Team are not responsible for the fake posts on our name\n\nWij 2Lions-Team zijn niet verantwoordelijk voor die zieke FAKE posten die op onze naam worden gedaan\n\nPlease check our site !!!\n\nto the fakers , get a life !!!\n\n*****************************************************\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:945fbd9d8eee2a5eef99c484a72977f76425e6cd","amp;dn":"V+2009+S01+E10+%28NL+EN+subs%29+HDTV+2Lions-Team","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"945fbd9d8eee2a5eef99c484a72977f76425e6cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,95,189,157,142,238,42,94,239,153,196,132,167,41,119,247,100,37,230,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
