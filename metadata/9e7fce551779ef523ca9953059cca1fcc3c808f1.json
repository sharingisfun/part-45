Then said I, Here am I;\nsend me. When Emma Davis reads the words of Isaiah 6:8\nin her room at a Georgia womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s college, she understands\nher true calling: to become a missionary. It is a leap of\nfaith that sweeps her away to Africa in an odyssey of\npersonal discovery, tremendous hardship, and profound\ntransformation. For the earnest, headstrong daughter of\na prosperous slave owner, living among the Yoruba people\nis utterly unlike EmmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sheltered childhoodÃ¢â‚¬â€as is her\nnew husband, Henry Bowman. Twenty years her senior, the\nmercurial Henry is the object of EmmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mad first love,\nintensifying the sensations of all they see and share\ntogether. Each day brings new tragedy and heartbreak,\nand each day, Emma somehow finds the hope, passion, and\nstrength of will to press onward. Through it all, HenryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nfirst gift to Emma, a simple writing boxÃ¢â‚¬â€with its red\nleather-bound diary and space for a few cherished\nkeepsakesÃ¢â‚¬â€becomes her closest confidant, EmmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last\nconnection to a life that seems, in this strange\nnew world, like a passing memory.\n\nA Different Sun\nBy: Elaine Neil Orr\nISBN13: 9781101622063\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 669","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e7fce551779ef523ca9953059cca1fcc3c808f1","amp;dn":"A+Different+Sun+by+Elaine+Neil+Orr.+EPUB+%28Perseu%29.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e7fce551779ef523ca9953059cca1fcc3c808f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,127,206,85,23,121,239,82,60,169,149,48,89,204,161,252,195,200,8,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
