Sites that I usually go to in search of information had little to none information on him. Therefore I will present everything that i found about him to ease the search of anyone who is looking for more about him. So about his early life i know nothing about, he kind of suddenly appeared in the late 60's in the city of Detroit (where he seems to have been quite a mythical habitant of the town) and released a couple of Albums for the Label Westbound. His first one, a self-titled, was released in 1971 and the follow-up, whose name I don't know (and even whose existence I am not sure) was released in 1973. Jonathon seems to have been quite a charismatic and insane personality, according to a testimony I found on a forum, in the Release party of his Album, Jonathon spiked the weed with Heroin. It seems that he Toured America quite extensively until stopping in Chicago to study Improv Arts, and since then he seems to have continued doing Improv Performances until the end of his days (I have no confirmation on his death).\nBest Tracks - &quot;In Question Of The Unicorn&quot;, &quot;Tolu&quot;, &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot;, &quot;Travelin' Mama Blues&quot;, &quot;Train-A-Comin'&quot; and &quot;And I Will Not Be Moved&quot;. The Cover was in a Round-Shape which wasn't used by anyone at the time, and features a fantastic photo of the big-bearded Giant that was Jonathon, even though in the normal version (without being round) there is a picture where he looks quite small. He wrote a book on Improv Performances, and apart from being a musician, he was also a Producer, Director, Playwright, Author, Composer, Actor, Singer, Musician, Teacher and a Coach. If anyone has any more information I would be glad to receive it and update this post, even though I think i won't even get one comment on this one.\n~ The Red Hippie\nTracklist:\n\n01.
