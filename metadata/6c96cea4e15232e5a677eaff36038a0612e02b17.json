After serving in the Coast Guard (playing in bands during 1942-1944) and freelancing around Boston, Haig worked steadily with Dizzy Gillespie (1945-1946), Charlie Parker (1948-1950), and Stan Getz (1949-1951); and was on many recordings, mostly as a sideman (including some classic Diz and Bird sessions) but also as a leader for Spotlite, Dawn, and Prestige. However (other than little-known dates in 1954 for Esoteric, Swing, and Period), Haig did not lead any more albums until 1974. He played fairly often during the 1951-1973 period, but was generally overlooked. That changed during his last decade, when he was finally recognized as a bop giant and recorded for Spotlite, Choice, SeaBreeze, Interplay, and several Japanese and European labels.\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Sweet Lorraine\n02 - Tea For Two\n03 - You Go To My Head\n04 - You Stepped Out Of A Dream\n05 - Undecided\n06 - The Man I Love\n07 - Woodyn' You\n08 - Stella By Starlight\n09 - Someone To Watch Over Me\n\nEnjoy and share!
