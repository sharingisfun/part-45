A shorter all-acoustic version of the song was featured on the soundtrack for Broken Bridges and was played by Keith in the movie. It peaked at #15 on the United States Country Charts.\n\nThe music video was directed by Michael Salomon, and it premiered on CMT's Top 20 Countdown on August 31, 2006. It features actress Heather Locklear.\n\nKevin John Coyne, reviewing the song for Country Universe, gave it a positive rating. He says that Toby has &quot;never sounded better, and heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finally recording adult and sophisticated material again.&quot; \n\nWhite Trash with Money is the eleventh album by country music superstar Toby Keith, which was released on April 11, 2006. It is Keith's first album on his own Show Dog Nashville label. The album shipped platinum, meaning one million or more units were distributed to outlets ahead of its release.\n\nIt features 12 tracks, including 3 &quot;Bus songs&quot;. Keith wrote or co-wrote all of the songs; co-writing credits go to his long-term writing partner, his friend Scotty Emerick, with several tracks also being co-written by Dean Dillon. Keith co-produced the album with Lari White. Three singles were released from it: &quot;Get Drunk and Be Somebody&quot;, &quot;A Little Too Late&quot; and &quot;Crash Here Tonight&quot;, which reached #3, #2, and #15, respectively, on the Hot Country Songs charts.\n\nToby Keith Covel (born July 8, 1961), best known as Toby Keith, is an American country music singer-songwriter, record producer and actor. Keith released his first four studio albums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 1993's Toby Keith, 1994's Boomtown, 1996's Blue Moon and 1997's Dream Walkin', plus a Greatest Hits package for various divisions of Mercury Records before exiting in 1998. These albums all earned gold or higher certification, and produced several chart singles, including his debut &quot;Should've Been a Cowboy&quot;, which topped the country charts and was the most played country song of the 1990s. The song has received three million spins since then, according to Broadcast Music Incorporated.\n\nSigned to Nashville DreamWorks in 1998, Keith released his breakthrough single &quot;How Do You Like Me Now?!&quot; that year. This song, the title track to his 1999 album of the same name, was the Number One country song of 2000, and one of several chart-toppers during his tenure on DreamWorks Nashville. His next three albums, Pull My Chain, Unleashed, and Shock'n Y'all, produced three more Number Ones each, and all of the albums were certified multi-platinum. A second Greatest Hits package followed in 2004, and after that, he released Honkytonk University.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9963d0bd21b54d758a3508480a189b83f276cf4e","amp;dn":"Toby+Keith+-+Crash+night+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9963d0bd21b54d758a3508480a189b83f276cf4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,99,208,189,33,181,77,117,138,53,8,72,10,24,155,131,242,118,207,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
