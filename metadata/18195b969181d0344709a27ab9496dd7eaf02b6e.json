Praised for her imaginative and illuminating interpretations of the classical repertoire, 26-year-old Ms. Fischer is equally lauded for her technical skill, with the Financial Times saying 'She may have spitfire technique... but in Fischer's case the notes are not an end in themselves but purely a means to expressing musical truths.' Julia Fischer confirms her position as a fore most virtuoso of the violin with her assured ascent of an Everest of the solo violin repertoire - Paganini's towering and fiendishly challenging 24 Caprices.\n\nViolinist Julia Fischer was born in Munich in 1983 and began learning the piano from her mother at the age of three. Soon she took up the violin as well and, following three years of studies at the Leopold Mozart Conservatory in Augsburg, she became a pupil of the renowned violin pedagogue Ana Chumachenco at the Munich Musikhochschule. In 1995, only eleven, she won the Yehudi Menuhin International Violin Competition. The following year, in Lisbon, she took first prize at the Eurovision Competition for Young InstruÃ‚Â¬mentalists and soon launched an international career that led to her breakthrough New York appearances in 2003 with conductor Lorin Maazel at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center.\nIn 2007 Julia Fischer was named Ã¢â‚¬Å“Artist of the YearÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at the Gramophone Awards. As one of the most sought-after musicians of her generation, she now performs regularly with all the leading orchestras and conductors of Europe and North America and at the most important festivals, including the BBC Proms. Highlights of her 2010Ã¢â‚¬â€œ11 season included her debut at the Salzburg Easter Festival with the Berliner Philharmoniker and Sir Simon Rattle in April 2011 and playing the Berg Concerto with the Cleveland Orchestra and Franz Welser-MÃƒÂ¶st. The artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2011-12 season featured MarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢eh, the new concerto written for Julia Fischer by Matthis Pintscher, of which she gave the world premiere with Vladimir Jurowski and the London Phiharmonic at the Lucerne Festival, followed by a European tour. She also toured Germany with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, appeared with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Charles Dutoit, the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra under David Zinman, the St. Petersburg Philharmonic under Yuri Temirkanov and the Dresden Staatskapelle under Juraj Valcuha and made recital tours of the US and Europe with pianist Milana Chernyavska.\nIn the 2012-13 season she is artist-in-residence at the Berlin Konzerthaus, opening the season with the Brahms Double Concerto alongside her longtime chamber partner Daniel MÃƒÂ¼ller-Schott, under the baton of the orchestraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new chief conductor IvÃƒÂ¡n Fischer. Further concerts with the orchestra, chamber music and a solo recital follow, and the residency concludes with her appearance in June 2013 with the Julia Fischer Quartet, founded in 2011, which has already garnered ecstatic acclaim from public and critics alike. Early 2013 will see her performing Bach, YsaÃƒÂ¿e and Hindemith in solo recitals at Carnegie HallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Zankel Hall as well as at Princeton University. Shortly thereafter, she will embark on tours with the National Symphony Orchestra under Christoph Eschenbach in Spain and Germany as well as with the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra with Zinman in Germany. The latter will coincide with DeccaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s release of her 2012 recording of BruchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Violin Concerto No. 1 and DvoÃ…â„¢ÃƒÂ¡kÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Violin Concerto with Zinman and the Tonhalle. Another season highlight will be her Vienna Philharmonic debut in May 2013, playing the Beethoven and Salonen Violin Concertos under Esa-Pekka Salonen.\nJulia Fischer, who has continued to play the piano throughout her career, made her profes-sional keyboard debut at the Alte Oper of Frankfurt in 2008 performing GriegÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Piano Concerto, and played Saint-SaÃƒÂ«nsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Violin Concerto no. 3 on the same evening. This much fÃƒÂªted concert was released on DVD by Decca in 2010.\nAn exclusive Decca recording artist since 2008, FischerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first album with her new label Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bach concertos as both leader and soloist with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was released in January 2009 to exceptional critical acclaim (MIDEM Classical Award 2009 Ã¢â‚¬Å“Instrumentalist of the YearÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). She has already won many prizes for her earlier recordings, including GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coveted Echo Award in 2005 and 2007, the BBC Music Magazine Award and FranceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prestigious Diapason dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢or and Choc du Monde de la musique. For her second Decca recording, featuring PaganiniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 24 Caprices, she obtained a GrammyÃ‚Â® nomination in 2010. PoÃƒÂ¨me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a lyrical and poetic set of impressionistic works for violin and orchestra Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was released in 2011. Her latest release is the DvoÃ…â„¢ÃƒÂ¡k-Bruch album that appears in early 2013.\nJulia Fischer, who regards teaching as a major component of her musical career, is a professor (GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s youngest) at the Hochschule fÃƒÂ¼r Musik in Frankfurt.\n\nComposer: Niccolo Paganini\nPerfomer: Julia Fischer\nAudio CD (September 7, 2010)\nNumber of Discs: 1\nFormat: FLAC(tracks)\nSize: 386 Mb\nLabel: Decca\nASIN: B003JVIB9Y\n\nTracklist\n\n1. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 1 in E\n2. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 2 in B minor\n3. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 3 in E minor\n4. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 4 in C minor\n5. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 5 in A minor\n6. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 6 in G minor\n7. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 7 in A minor\n8. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 8 in E flat\n9. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 9 in E\n10. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 10 in G minor\n11. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 11 in C\n12. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 12 in A flat\n13. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 13 in B flat\n14. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 14 in E flat\n15. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 15 in E minor\n16. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 16 in G minor\n17. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 17 in E flat\n18. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 18 in C\n19. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 19 in E flat\n20. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 20 in D\n21. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 21 in A\n22. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 22 in F\n23. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 23 in E flat\n24. 24 Caprices for Violin, Op.1 - No. 24 in A minor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18195b969181d0344709a27ab9496dd7eaf02b6e","amp;dn":"Paganini%3A+24+Caprices+-+Julia+Fischer+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18195b969181d0344709a27ab9496dd7eaf02b6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,25,91,150,145,129,208,52,71,9,162,122,185,73,109,215,234,240,43,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
