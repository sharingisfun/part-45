Mr. Fein is an ardent critic of Bush, Clinton and Obama and has singled out the government's so-called terrorist surveillance program. Fein proposed impeaching Obama in connection with the 2011 military intervention in Libya. He founded the American Freedom Agenda with Bob Barr, David Keene and Richard Viguerie. Bruce Fein is the author of American Empire: Before the Fall. Alex also covers the news, including Obama's grandstanding over the unsubstantiated death of Osama bin Laden and the outrageous government plan to evacuate Chicago during the globalist and NATO summit.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
