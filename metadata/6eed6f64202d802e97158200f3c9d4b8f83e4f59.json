That's likely going to be my next upload.\n\nThis is Lynyrd Skynyrd's set from their 1976 performance at Knebworth.\n\nArtist: &quot;Lynyrd Skynyrd&quot;\nAlbum: &quot;1976.08.21 - Knebworth England&quot;\nGenre: &quot;Southern Rock&quot;\nDate: &quot;1976&quot;\n\nBrilliant stuff, plain and simple.
