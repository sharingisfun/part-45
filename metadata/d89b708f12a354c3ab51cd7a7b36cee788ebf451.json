But, they find a Cybertronian spaceship, \nand Arcee goes investigating the it. Afterwards Arcee tells Jack she knows who the ship belongs to. \nA flashback reveals a mysterious female Cybertronian stabbing another Cybertronian. \nShe attempts in vain to contact base to request a Groundbridge. Leaving Jack by the ship, \nArcee walks out into the trees to find a trail left by her mystery assailant, \nand again flashes back when she had been captured. Jack interrupts her, \nand she transforms before driving them both at high speed through the trees for a distance. \nWhen she still can't contact base, she drops Jack off on the other side of a deep crevasse and heads back. \nJack starts climbing down the side of the crevasse. Arcee, scouting among the trees, \nfinds a tree stump covered in an acidic compound, and has another flashback. Arcee radios Tailgate, \na member of the Delta Team and her partner, for help. Until, she is globbed with webbing \nand then held capture by the female Cybertronian. Elsewhere, the exact same Cybertronian moves \nin on an unsuspecting camper in a tent. As she jumps to strike, she is tackled by Arcee, \nand the pair roll downhill to a clearing. Amused to be reunited with the Autobot after all this time, \nshe is identified to be Airachnid, a spider-like Decepticon. Then she later reveals her new hobby: \ncollecting the heads of endangered species, though most of them weren't endangered until she got to them. \nNow she has her sights set on a human for her next trophy. Arcee begins fighting her, but Jack arrives, \ndistracting Arcee long enough for Airachnid to web her to a nearby rock. Arcee cuts her arm free and \nzaps Airachnid before informing Jack that he's more a liability than a partner, however Jack doesn't believe her. \nBut, Arcee has another flashback. Finding Arcee a tough nut to crack, Airachnid has a couple of Vehicons drag in Tailgate. \nArcee, however much she wants to save her partner, doesn't know the attack coordinates, and Airachnid kills Tailgate. \nAirachnid recovers from being shot and says she's heard about Cliffjumper's death. As Jack flees, \nAirachnid promises to finish Arcee later, then she begins pursuing the boy. Arcee flashes back once more. \nAs Airachnid moves in on her prisoner once again, Bumblebee and Cliffjumper burst in to make a rescue. \nThough Airachnid escapes, they cut down Arcee and carry her out as she tells them she couldn't save Tailgate. \nArcee begins trying to escape from the webbing she's been trapped in. Meanwhile, Jack continues running, \nscaling the sides of the crevasse again. He pauses behind a tree to look at his pocket knife before realizing \nit won't be much use against a Airachnid. He reaches Airachnid's spaceship and hides against it as she searches around. \nWhile clambering around it, he finds a Energon leaking from a port on the underside of the spaceship. \nGrabbing a nearby stick, he uses his pocket knife and flint to set fire to it, then throws it into the leaking port. \nAirachnid, now standing on top of the ship, yells his name as the ship explodes. Jack runs away, thinking that Airachnid has died, \nalthough he is wrong, and Airachnid slings a web on his foot, and Jack can no longer move. \nAirachnid climbs down a tree and attempts to kill Jack. Until, Arcee attacks Airachnid and defeats her. \nBut, Airachnid is still alive and escapes underground. Communications at Autobot HQ are working again, \nso Arcee calls for a Groundbridge, and finally calls Jack &quot;partner.&quot;\n \n[B]First Appearances:[B/] Airachnid, Tailgate\n \n[B]Reference:[/B] This episode contains 4 or 5 possible references to the Predator franchise: \nAirachnid's ship entering Earth's atmosphere resembles the movie's opening scene, \nAirachnid coming to Earth with the sole purpose of hunting humans echoes the Predator's motive, \nAirachnid's trophy case of heads is similar to one seen in Predator 2, \nand the scene in which Jack uses a personally made flaming &quot;arrow&quot; to ignite energon resembles a \ntactic used by Arnold Schwarzenegger's character in the first film. \nThe title &quot;Predatory&quot; may also be just as much a reference to Predator as it is to Predacons.\n \n[B]Fact #1:[/B] The sound effects used for when Airachnid spews her webbing are the same used for \nSpider-Man in the 2008 The Spectacular Spider-Man, in which Josh Keaton (Jack) voiced the title character.\n \n[B]Fact #2:[/B] Optimus, Ratchet, Bulkhead, Miko, and Raf don't appear in this episode. Also, the other Decepticons, \nbeside Airachnid don't appear in this episode, ether.\n\n[B] Note:[/B] Susan Blu does not do any voice directing in this episode. Instead, Jamie Simone does the voice directing here. \n\n[B]Spoken language:[/B] English\n====================================================================================\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nCast\n===========\n\nSeries cast summary: \n----------------------\n\nKevin Michael Richardson  ...
