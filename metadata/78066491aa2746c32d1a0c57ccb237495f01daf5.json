Start small, with just a simple space to begin with, convince heroes to work for you then build, expand and continue to grow your kingdom as your Heroes help surrounding settlements and rid the world of the evil that it contains. It is your challenge to use all of the resources available to you to attract adventurers into your kingdom and grow its fame in order to become the greatest kingdom in the land!\r\n\r\n Inspired by some of the classic tycoon games many of us grew up playing, RPG Tycoon aims to create a familiar yet original experience for players of all ages. Giving you the freedom to develop your kingdom how you please... You can focus on questing, aiming to hire as many heroes as you can, levelling them and training them to be the best heroes in the land by sending them on quests, forcing them to complete bounties and slay villains or you can build and grow, turning your kingdom into a tourist empire with shops and facilities milking every last bit of gold from the adventurers you're attracting...
