For the first time in 100 years, readers will find the original Songs of Freedom as well as the 1919 Connolly Souvenir program published in Dublin for a concert commemorating Connolly's birth. Both are reproduced exactly as they originally appeared, providing a fascinating glimpse of the workers' struggle at the beginning of the last century. To complete the picture, it also includes the James Connolly Songbook of 1972, which contains not only the most complete selection of Connolly's lyrics but also historical background essential to \nunderstanding the context in which the songs were written and performed.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://matcallahan.com/pictures/Songs_of_freedom.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://matcallahan.com/pictures/Songs_of_freedom.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c5811b712675d4ac8d1d968061c958d5aa40815","amp;dn":"Songs+of+Freedom%3A+The+James+Connolly+Songbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c5811b712675d4ac8d1d968061c958d5aa40815","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,88,17,183,18,103,93,74,200,209,217,104,6,28,149,141,90,164,8,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
