They were originally established with American rock band Elf's members, but Blackmore fired all the members except Ronnie James Dio who would leave in 1979. Three British musicians joined in 1979, singer Graham Bonnet, keyboardist Don Airey, former Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover, and this line-up gave the band their commercial breakthrough with the single &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot;. Over the years Rainbow went through many line-up changes with no two studio albums featuring the same line-up. Other lead singers Joe Lynn Turner and Doogie White would follow, and the project consisted of numerous backing musicians. The band started out combining mystical lyric themes with neoclassical metal, but went in a more streamlined commercial style following Dio's departure from the group.\n\nRainbow were ranked No. 90 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band has sold over 28 million albums worldwide and 4 million albums in the United States.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRitchie Blackmore's Rainbow (sometimes stylised Ritchie Blackmore's R-A-I-N-B-O-W) is the first album by British rock guitarist Ritchie Blackmore's solo band Rainbow, released in 1975.\n\nThe original vinyl release had a gate fold sleeve, although later budget reissues on Polydor reduced to a single sleeve. The album's songs have been performed by subsequent Rainbow line-ups.\n\nThe album was widely praised for its fantasy/heroic-like lyrical content and the innovative rock style.\n\nRitchie Blackmore's Rainbow was re-issued on CD in remastered form in the US in April 1999. The European release followed later in the year.\n\nVocalist Ronnie James Dio considered this release his favourite Rainbow album.\n\nDespite the title implying the record being a Ritchie Blackmore solo release, in later years Blackmore has jokingly stated that Dio's contributions warranted a re-titling of &quot;Ritchie Blackmore and Ronnie James Dio's Rainbow&quot;.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRainbow:\n\nRonnie James Dio: lead vocals\nRitchie Blackmore: guitar\nMicky Lee Soule: piano, mellotron, clavinet, organ\nCraig Gruber: bass\nGary Driscoll: drums\n\nWith:\n\nShoshana Ã¢â‚¬â€œ backing vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18421b6299dfb46cdae779c89d6b42791260680b","amp;dn":"Rainbow%2FRainbow+%5B1975%5D%5B2008%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D%5BJPNSHMCD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18421b6299dfb46cdae779c89d6b42791260680b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,66,27,98,153,223,180,108,218,231,121,200,157,107,66,121,18,96,104,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
