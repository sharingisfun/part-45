Thursday is one of those bands. After\n   penning a post-hardcore masterpiece in Full Collapse and breaking into the\n   mainstream with War All The Time, Geoff Rickly and company revamped\n   themselves into a less abrasive, more melodic and certainly more experimental\n   band with A City By The Light Divided. Their ongoing quest for a constantly\n   changing musical identity has again and again brought listeners to new\n   realms, and ThursdayÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s newest opus No DevoluciÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¤n is no exception. A beautiful\n   display of a bandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s ability to evolve while creating a surreal environment\n   from start to finish, No DevoluciÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¤n proves to be the most moving album\n   Thursday has penned since they gave us Full Collapse nearly ten years ago.\n   What sets No DevoluciÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¤n apart from the records theyÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ve released since Full\n   Collapse is the success Thursday is able to achieve in creating a memorable\n   atmosphere musically. The bombastic opening of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Fast to the EndÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ is quickly\n   subsided by driving drums and lush, dense melodies. RicklyÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s gentle vocals\n   mix well given their production to a slightly raspy output as well, giving\n   this album a very memorable beginning. From the first track, producer Dave\n   Fridmann does an amazing job melding the sounds this band cranks out\n   regardless of the mood ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» a sure sign of the comfort level built between the\n   band and Fridmann over the now three albums theyÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ve recorded together. The\n   experimenting with lush melodies continues in ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´No AnswersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ as a droning hum\n   pushes things along while Rickly again takes center stage. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´A Darker ForestÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶\n   brings a darker timbre to the table, with eerie guitars and a snare-driven\n   drum beat building the tension at the introduction. When it resolves to the\n   chorus, the melodies stay dark while the drums and vocals go to another\n   level. What is strange about the delving into darker melodies on this record\n   is that after listening to ThursdayÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s split with Envy, none of this seems\n   like it was ever out of reach for these guys.\n   ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Past and Future RuinsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶, a track featured recently on a split with Underoath,\n   features spurts of abrasion and melody between sections of driving toms and\n   moving keys. It also shows us one of the few hints of unclean vocals on the\n   record in the culmination of the chorus as the fuzzy, grizzly vocals help\n   push the chorus over the edge. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Magnets Caught in a Metal HeartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ is more in\n   the vein of indie-rock, channeling crisp, yet delicate guitar melodies and\n   echoed vocals to create a rather surreal sound that embraces the atmosphere\n   it creates. Thursday even channels a somewhat industrial feel in ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´A Gun in\n   the First ActÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ by their use of grimy programming on top of the off-kilter\n   drumming from Tucker Rule. The one true sidewinder comes in the form of\n   ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´MillimeterÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶, which harkens sounds of Flock of Seagulls more than anything\n   else. It takes some time to get used to (what part of this record really\n   doesnÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t?), but you could argue they own the song nonetheless. It all seems\n   effortless regardless of the path they take, as Thursday proves to be a\n   master at creating moving atmospheric backdrops for their melodies and\n   vocals. If you were looking for a return to the past given the bandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s touring\n   on Full Collapse or even a rehashing of Common Existence, you will be in for\n   quite a shock when your ears hear what No DevoluciÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¤n has to offer.\n   On their sixth time recording a full length, Thursday has never seemed so\n   sure of what they were creating as they sound on No DevoluciÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¤n. It seems time\n   has only made this band more focused and realized, and the tracks here prove\n   once again that Thursday will not sit still regardless of what anyone has to\n   say about them.\\&quot;\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
