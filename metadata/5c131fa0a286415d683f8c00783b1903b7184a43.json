The box labeled Hard disk (no sandbox) shows changes by a program running normally. The box labeled Hard disk (with sandbox) shows changes by a program running under Sandboxie. The animation illustrates that Sandboxie is able to intercept the changes and isolate them within a sandbox, depicted as a yellow rectangle. It also illustrates that grouping the changes together makes it easy to delete all of them at once.\n\n\n[b]Benefits of the Isolated Sandbox[/b]\n\n    * Secure Web Browsing: Running your Web browser under the protection of Sandboxie means that all malicious software downloaded by the browser is trapped in the sandbox and can be discarded trivially. \n\n    * Enhanced Privacy: Browsing history, cookies, and cached temporary files collected while Web browsing stay in the sandbox and don't leak into Windows. \n\n    * Secure E-mail: Viruses and other malicious software that might be hiding in your email can't break out of the sandbox and can't infect your real system. \n\n    * Windows Stays Lean: Prevent wear-and-tear in Windows by installing software into an isolated sandbox. \n\n\nHomepage: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInfo Hash: 5C131FA0 A286415D 683F8C00 783B1903 B7184A43 \n\n\n==========================================================================\n\n\nReport bad torrents here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy uploads: &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n==========================================================================\n\t\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c131fa0a286415d683f8c00783b1903b7184a43","amp;dn":"Sandboxie.v3.40+%2B+Key+%28WinAll%29+%5BBeLLBoY%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c131fa0a286415d683f8c00783b1903b7184a43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,19,31,160,162,134,65,93,104,63,140,0,120,59,25,3,183,24,74,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
