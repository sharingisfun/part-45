ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not their music or\never-changing image that's the problem. It's Corey's lack of lyrics. He just can't\nthink of anything cool to write about, until... he finds his older sister Trina's\ndiary. &quot;Hey! This thing is full of teen angst and junk.&quot; Core and the band\n'secretly' use her latest diary entry for lyrics to their new tune - and what do\nyou know? It sounds like pure awesomeness and the gigs are lining up! Problem solved\nright? Not exactly. Trina's a total witch and can't stand the thought of her little\nbrother's garbage band becoming more popular than her. She'll stop at nothing to\ncrush their dreams. But that's cool. Core can read his sister, well... like a book.\nAnd he always knows just what to do to make her go diary and give them the one thing\nthey're missing... words! Follow Corey and his GROJBAND as they reach for the top.\nGasp at the things they'll do to his sister's fragile teenage world to get there.\n\nProduced by Fresh TV and Teletoon Canada.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img855/710/73t8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img855/710/73t8.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCorey thinks Underground music is the band's thing.
