It will not run under other types of Windows NT such as Windows NT for DEC Alpha or Windows NT for PowerPCÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®.\n\nAdobe Photoshop 7.0 requires Windows NT Service Pack 6a or higher.\n\nMany files installed by Photoshop - such as TWAIN support files and MSVCRT*.* files \n(Microsoft runtime files) are shared with other programs. When you install or \nuninstall other programs that use these shared files, the file versions used by \nPhotoshop may be overwritten or deleted. If you experience problems with features \nthat depend on shared files, reinstall Photoshop\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nInitialization and Preferences Files\n\nYou can find the Photoshop 7.0 preference files in the following locations:\n\nWindows 98: \nWindows\\Application Data\\Adobe\\Photoshop\\7.0\\Adobe Photoshop 7.0 Settings\n\nWindows NT: \nWinNT\\profiles\\&lt;username&gt;\\Application Data\\Adobe\\Photoshop\\7.0\\Adobe Photoshop 7.0 Settings\n\nWindows 2000 and XP:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\&lt;username&gt;\\Application Data\\Adobe\\Photoshop\\7.0\\Adobe Photoshop 7.0 Settings\n\nNote:  The Application Data folder is a hidden folder and not visible by default.
