It is linked to the metal element and positively affects the lungs. Pi Chuan's main focus is to make the spine extremely strong and the hands as hard as steel.\n\nBruce wrote:\nThe overwhelming majority of people who practice internal martial art forms do it to be healthy. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do it for martial power. However, if you practice for martial power, health comes as a bonus. Everything you do becomes dramatically stronger.\n\nThe system of Hsing-i is based upon storing an immense amount of chi in the lower tantien, and then allowing it to spread throughout the body to be used at will. In China it is known as one of the most direct ways to make your body strong and healthy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8cd69ecb25322f86558d1f66ff45ddc4b967093","amp;dn":"bruce+frantzis+-+metal+fist+-+xingyi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8cd69ecb25322f86558d1f66ff45ddc4b967093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,205,105,236,178,83,34,248,101,88,209,246,111,244,93,220,75,150,112,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
