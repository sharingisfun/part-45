ONE WEEK AFTER THE PUBLICATION, THE SAME NEWSPAPER MADE INTERVIEWS WITH PRIESTS, INTELLECTUALS AND HOMOSEXUALS. ALL WERE AGAINST YOUR STATEMENTS. I BROUGHT SOME OF THE REACTIONS AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO COMMENT.\r\nFATHER DOMINGOS*, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND PROGRESSIVE PRIESTS IN BRAZIL, SAID, &quot;MR. BHAGWAN IS PROPOSING JOY. IS IT ENOUGH FOR BEING HAPPY TO HAVE GOOD HOUSE AND GOOD FOOD? AND HOW TO LIBERATE THE SPIRIT?&quot;\r\nHE IS ALSO SAYING THAT YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD INFORMATIONS AND THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THE WORK OF THE CHURCH WITH THE POOR, AND ESPECIALLY THE POPE'S STATEMENT WHICH SAYS, &quot;WHEREVER IS PRIVATE PROPERTY THERE IS HUMAN MISERY, AND THE CHURCH HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST IT.&quot;\r\n\r\nANSWER:* There are so many things in that statement.\r\nFirst, the church has private properties. So what the nonsense he is talking about? The first thing the churches should do, they should disown private properties if they mean business. Otherwise this is bullshit....\r\nall text is attached as file","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0bea294a0c60d7308fc9fc2a4b3b1a80e39b6bd","amp;dn":"Osho_The+last+Testament_Vol-3+%2320_Brazil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0bea294a0c60d7308fc9fc2a4b3b1a80e39b6bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,190,162,148,160,198,13,115,8,252,159,194,164,179,177,168,14,57,182,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
