StÃƒÂ©phane, a Swiss biologist living in Kent, responds: his father is one of the people in the photo. Letters and more photos pass between them as they embark on a journey to uncover the truth their parents kept from them. But will the relics of the past fill the silences left by the players?\n\nWinner of fifteen literary awards, this dark yet touching drama deftly explores the themes of blame and forgiveness, identity and love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0d50febdd05021cdc6467f93288dbb92d691014","amp;dn":"The+People+in+the+Photo+by+Helene+Gestern++%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0d50febdd05021cdc6467f93288dbb92d691014","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,213,15,235,221,5,2,28,220,100,103,249,50,136,219,185,45,105,16,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
