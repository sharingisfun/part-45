When A Child Is Born\n\n\nAmazon Review:\nKenny Rogers became such a sensation not only because his warm voice could be gravelly and smooth, but also because of his knack for weaving a yarn. And what would Christmas be without someone telling stories that made you laugh, or cry, or just feel warm and fuzzy? Christmas doesn't really pull any surprises, but fans won't be disappointed by Rogers's crooning of &quot;White Christmas&quot; and &quot;Carol of the Bells.&quot; His voice has always done well in the upper reaches of its range, and by including &quot;O Holy Night,&quot; Rogers has chosen wisely: His delivery at the song's end can give goose bumps. &quot;Kentucky Homemade Christmas&quot; and Rogers's handling of both &quot;Christmas Is My Favorite Time of the Year&quot; and &quot;Kids&quot; proves he can still spin a tale as well as he can carry a tune.\n\nAllmusic Review:\nRecorded at his commercial peak, Rogers' Christmas features both contemporary material (&quot;Kentucky Homemade,&quot; &quot;Kids&quot;) and more traditional fare (&quot;White Christmas,&quot; &quot;O Holy Night&quot;); while recommended for fans, casual listeners are advised to seek out other country holiday LPs instead. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:791da155440dcd685df45979cbbdc1356eb6f996","amp;dn":"Kenny+Rogers+-+Christmas+Greetings+%5BOriginal+Recording+Reissued%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"791da155440dcd685df45979cbbdc1356eb6f996","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,29,161,85,68,13,205,104,93,244,89,121,203,189,193,53,110,182,249,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
