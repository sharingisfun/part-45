A hilarious saga of good intentions confounded, the story chronicles a firemenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ball where nothing goes rightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from a beauty pageant whose reluctant participants embarrass the organizers to a lottery from which nearly all the prizes are pilfered. Presumed to be a commentary on the floundering Czech leadership, the film was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbanned foreverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in Czechoslovakia following the Russian invasion and prompted FormanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s move to America.\n\n-\n\nThe last, best, and funniest movie Milos Forman would make in his native Czechoslovakia, The FiremenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ball is a deceptively simple miniature. This 73-minute movie, its premise scarcely more than an anecdote, finds an entire universe in the benefit gala staged by a group of inept, officious, mildly corruptÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in short, intensely humanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½volunteer firefighters.\n\nForman, whose international reputation as a leading member of the Czech new wave was established with his rueful 1965 comedy Loves of a Blonde, had left Prague for the Krkonose mountain village of VrchlabÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­, there to develop a follow-up screenplay with his colleagues Ivan Passer and Jaroslav Papousek. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOne evening, to amuse ourselves, we went to a real firemenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ball,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he recalled. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat we saw was such a nightmare that we didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop talking until the next day about it. So we abandoned what we were writing on to start writing this script.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nA Czech-Italian co-production (according to Forman, it was Carlo PontiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s $65,000 that enabled the movie to be made in color), The FiremenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ball was shot in VrchlabÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ with an entirely nonprofessional cast. The protagonist is the town itself. Forman has assembled an impressive ensemble of grotesque types and fantastic faces. The movieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s droll naturalism occasionally flirts with cuteness, but its deadpan comedy is darkened by an unwaveringly clear-eyed view of human stupidity and deception.\n\nThe ball is a series of small catastrophes, absurd ceremonies, and inane intriguesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½these rendered all the more ridiculous by the firemenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tendency toward self-important official rhetoric and coercive authoritarianism. Just about everything that can go wrong does. Decorations fall from the ceiling. The brass band misses its cues. The lottery prizes are pilfered by those assigned to watch over them. The reluctant participants in a beauty contest run for cover and, in the confusion, a fat middle-aged lady happily crowns herself the winner. A fire breaks out in the middle of the feteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a particularly haunting sequence, as everyone leaves the ball to watch the heroes in action. As the townÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new fire engine gets stuck in a drift, the firemen are reduced to ineffectually shoveling snow on the flames, then return to the hall to find the remaining prizes missing. The movieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s comic acme comes when the firemen dim the lights so that the culprits can replace the purloined goods, then turn them back on too soonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½catching one of their own as he attempts to replace a massive head cheese.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll never live down the disgrace of his putting it back,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ one smoke-eater moans, and in the unlikely event that any Czech viewer (or, indeed, anyone else) missed the correspondences between these bossy firefighters and a leading segment of Czech society, Forman ends with a backstage meeting where the firemen squabble among themselves over stolen prizes and, citing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe honor of the brigade,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ decide that everyone at the ball is a suspect. (After all, those who didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t steal could have.) The movieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s final imageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the smoldering ruins of an old manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s farmhouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½makes a particularly prescient ending.\n\nCompleted in mid-1967, The FiremenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ball exemplifies the ironic humanism and sly political allegory characteristic of the Czech New Wave. It also managed to offend everyone from its Italian producer to the Czech head of state to the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s volunteer firemen. The movie was shelved for a year; released at the height of the heady political thaw known as Prague Spring, it was playing theaters when the country was invaded by its Warsaw Pact allies in August 1968. An inescapable symbol of CzechoslovakiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s doomed reforms, The FiremenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ball had its American premiere a month later, closing the same 1968 New York Film Festival that featured Jan NemecÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Report on the Party and the Guests, another movie that was initially banned, then released, and would never again be publicly shown in communist Czechoslovakia.Forman, who soon after relocated to the United States, has always maintained that The FiremenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ball has no ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhidden symbols or double meanings.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The movie is not without a sharp political edge but it is not exactly an allegory. Subsequent viewings transform FormanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s deceptively slight masterpiece into something more mysteriousÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a sort of bemused documentary meditation on the non-actors who populate the screen. Few evocations of the human comedy have been so bitter and so sweet.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/vlcsnap-2012-01-21-04h46m20s74.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/vlcsnap-2012-01-21-04h46m20s74.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/vlcsnap-2012-01-21-04h46m41s29.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/vlcsnap-2012-01-21-04h46m41s29.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/vlcsnap-2012-01-21-04h47m56s220.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/vlcsnap-2012-01-21-04h47m56s220.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/vlcsnap-2012-01-21-04h48m07s63.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/vlcsnap-2012-01-21-04h48m07s63.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/vlcsnap-2012-01-21-04h48m22s205.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/vlcsnap-2012-01-21-04h48m22s205.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------not my rip-------\n\n~~~~~~ Hori ma panenko.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n\n                                                               \n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,467,949,056                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \n\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:13:54                \n\nFrame Count:....................................106296             \n\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640                  \n\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................480                  \n\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.333                     \n\nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \n\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................2449                 \n\n......MPEG-4..............................                    \n\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.332&quot;                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \n\nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \n\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \n\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \n\nAudio Channel Count:............................1        \n\n*************************\n\n    Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
