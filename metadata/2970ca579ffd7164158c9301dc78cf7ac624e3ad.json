You play as one of four deadly mercenaries on a team that's been commissioned to bring back the kidnapped daughter of a powerful Chinese executive. The action begins with Hana, Glas, and Deke the three main characters from the original game meeting each other for the first time. Soon afterward they meet Rain, a close friend of Hana's. Hana, Glas, and Deke are on separate missions to retrieve three objects, but before long they realize that they're involved in the same deadly plot. The action takes the foursome through Hong Kong, Hell's Kitchen in New York City, the walled city of Xi'an, the lost tomb of the first emperor of China, and in the end, to the mountain island of the immortals, Penglai Shan. Then, after lunch, things really get crazy!\n\n\n\n\nTested and working on all CFW's 5.00 m33 and above using the 500 popsloader pack set on 3.72 POPS...KloWn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2970ca579ffd7164158c9301dc78cf7ac624e3ad","amp;dn":"%28PSX-PSP%29+Fear+Effect+2%3ARetro+Helix+converted+properly+%28Kingdom-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2970ca579ffd7164158c9301dc78cf7ac624e3ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,112,202,87,159,253,113,100,21,140,147,1,220,120,207,122,198,36,227,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
