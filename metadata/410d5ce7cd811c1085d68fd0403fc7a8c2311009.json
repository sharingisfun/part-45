A stranger comes to the house - Ruth's cousin - with a picture of Ruth, age 8, in Berlin, with a woman the cousin says helped Ruth escape. Hannah, Ruth's daughter engaged to a gentile, goes to Berlin to find the woman, Lena Fisher, now 90. Posing as a journalist investigating intermarriage, Hannah interviews Lena who tells the story of a week in 1943 when the Jewish husbands of Aryan women were detained in a building on Rosenstrasse. The women gather daily for word of their husbands. The film goes back and forth to tell Ruth and Lena's story. How will it affect Hannah?\n\n===========================================\n\nRuntime: 02:09:61\n\nVideo Codec: XviD\nFrame Size: 640x272\nFPS: 25.00\nVideo Bitrate: 1117 Kbps\n\n\nAudio Codec: Dolby AC3 / 48000 Hz 6ch\nAudio bitrate: 448Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:410d5ce7cd811c1085d68fd0403fc7a8c2311009","amp;dn":"Rosenstrasse.2003.DVDRiP.XViD.Subs.Eng.Esp.Fr.PtBr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"410d5ce7cd811c1085d68fd0403fc7a8c2311009","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,13,92,231,205,129,28,16,133,214,143,208,64,63,199,168,194,49,16,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
