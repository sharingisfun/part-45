It was recorded in Amsterdam in the Netherlands in March, 1969. It is a performance by the trio organization. Improvisation with extraordinary power. It fills with a sad lyricism. It is a work being recognized again for an excellent live band SOFT MACHINE.\n\nAmazing. Best line-up. Soft Machine as a trio is one of the greatest bands from the late 60's. This performance is historical &amp; the sound quality is also great. Wyatt is a huge artist. Absolutely masterpiece and one of the great live albums of all times. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n1.
