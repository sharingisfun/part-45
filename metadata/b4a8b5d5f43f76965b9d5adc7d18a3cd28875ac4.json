During the 07/08 season, the Reds produced some stunning soccer and secured their 17th league title on a tension-filled final day at Wigan, before traveling to Moscow to complete an incredible double. In the exciting and stressful finale, Manchester United was just one penalty kick away from defeat when a slip and a Van der Sar save let Fergie's men capture the European Cup for a third time. Relive the glory of a truly momentous season, savor all of Ronaldo's incredible 42 goals and hear exclusive insight from Sir Alex, Giggsy, Rio, Rooney and Carlos Tevez among others. Make it a double. . . Champions of England and Champions of Europe!\n\nRelease Date: June 9, 2008\n\nFormat: NTSC\n\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4a8b5d5f43f76965b9d5adc7d18a3cd28875ac4","amp;dn":"Manchester.United.The.Double.Champions.Season.Review.2007.2008.a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4a8b5d5f43f76965b9d5adc7d18a3cd28875ac4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,168,181,213,244,63,118,150,91,157,90,220,125,24,163,205,40,135,90,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
