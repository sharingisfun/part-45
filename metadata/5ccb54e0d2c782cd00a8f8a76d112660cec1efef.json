A \n\npair of '60s gigs at the Sands (of which Sinatra was part owner) capture \n\nan artist still building on his musical legacy in the midst of rock's \n\nrising fortunes. The 1961 show turns on the riches of his Capitol years, \n\na musically straightforward set that balances the singer's \n\ninterpretations of reflective material like &quot;Moonlight in Vermont&quot; and \n\n&quot;In the Still of the Night&quot; with upbeat, typically playful renditions of \n\nsuch Sinatra signatures as &quot;Young at Heart,&quot; &quot;The Lady Is a Tramp,&quot; and \n\n&quot;Witchcraft.&quot;\n\n\nBut it's the '66 performance that may be the most intriguing for \n\nSinatraphiles: A live workout with Count Basie and his orchestra that \n\neschews the singer's mid-decade comeback hits--and even material from the \n\nrecent Sinatra-Basie collaboration--in favor of a sassy set that's less \n\nsummit meeting than swinging soirÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e, a freewheeling highlight reel from \n\nhis back catalog that finds singer and band engaging each other with \n\nplayful, often dizzy abandon. The anthology's '82 and '87 sets from \n\nCaesar's and the Golden Nugget, respectively, aren't nearly as musically \n\nchallenging, showcasing a vocalist and still-boisterous crowd-pleaser who \n\nmight have stopped breaking musical ground, yet never ceased reveling in \n\nthe glories--and laughs--he could still bring to the moment. Rat Pack \n\npartner in crime Dean Martin stops by Caesar's for some good-natured \n\nrazzing, while daughter Nancy guests on the set's lovably ditzy take on \n\n&quot;Somethin' Stupid.&quot; --Jerry McCulley\n\n\n--\nDisc 1 - Recorded at the Sands, Las Vegas, NV November 1961\n\n1.
