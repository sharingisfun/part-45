KÃ¤Ã¤riÃ¤inen et al. (Wiley-Scrivener, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nSince the first edition was published in 2008, Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) has emerged as a powerful, and sometimes preferred, deposition technology. The new edition of this groundbreaking monograph is the first text to review the subject of ALD comprehensively from a practical perspective. It covers ALD's application to microelectronics (MEMS) and nanotechnology; many important new and emerging applications; thermal processes for ALD growth of nanometer thick films of semiconductors, oxides, metals and nitrides; and the formation of organic and hybrid materials","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:293bc4ee482ae1d14683a9f24675688ec355aebe","amp;dn":"Atomic+Layer+Deposition+-+Principles%2C+Characteristics%2C+and+Nanot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"293bc4ee482ae1d14683a9f24675688ec355aebe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,59,196,238,72,42,225,209,70,131,169,242,70,117,104,142,195,85,174,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
