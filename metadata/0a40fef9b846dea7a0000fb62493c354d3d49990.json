Not one to shy away from the grisly realities of middle age, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“slyly subversiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (O, The Oprah Magazine) Gurwitch confronts the various indignities faced by femmes dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un certain age with candor, wit, and a healthy dose of hilarious self-deprecation. \n\nWhether falling in lust at the Genius bar, navigating the extensiveÃ¢â‚¬â€and treacherously expensiveÃ¢â‚¬â€anti aging offerings at a department-store beauty counter, coping with the assisted suicide of her best friend, negotiating the ins and outs of acceptable behavior with her teenage kid, or the thudding financial reality of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“never-tirementÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ generation that leads her to petty theft, GurwitchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s essays prove her a remarkably astute writer in her prime (in so many ways). Is this the beginning of the Eileen Fisher years? Where does one conduct an affair with a younger man? Is 50 the new 40? Or is 50 still justÃ¢â‚¬Â¦50?\n\nScorchingly honest, surreally and riotously funny, I See You Made an Effort is the ultimate coming-of-middle-age story and a must-read for women of all ages. Reading glasses not included. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a40fef9b846dea7a0000fb62493c354d3d49990","amp;dn":"I+See+You+Made+an+Effort-+Annabelle+Gurwitch+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a40fef9b846dea7a0000fb62493c354d3d49990","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,64,254,249,184,70,222,167,160,0,15,182,36,147,195,84,211,212,153,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
