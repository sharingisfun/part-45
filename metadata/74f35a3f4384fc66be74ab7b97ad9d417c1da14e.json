The film is based on a play by Richard Walton Tully and stars Dolores del Rio, Joel McCrea, John Halliday, Richard 'Skeets' Gallagher and Bert Roach. \n\nFrom legendary OscarÃ‚Â®-winning director King Vidor comes an exotic tale of romance set in gorgeous Polynesia.\n\nJohnny (Joel McCrea) is an intrepid young sailor traveling the South Seas who falls in love with Luana (Dolores del Rio), the beautiful daughter of an island chief. But Luana is betrothed to a neighboring native prince, and is soon to be married. With little thought to the future, Johnny and Luana elope together, searching for paradise in each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arms.\nWith McCrea at his most dashing and del Rio at her alluring height, Bird of Paradise is a movie of wild eroticism and thrilling adventure, and not to be missed.\n\nVidor's take on the South Sea idyll finds him on feverishly extravagant form, epitomised by the scene where a lightly clad, trussed-up white boy and native girl, under sentence of imminent death, contort themselves to achieve a final kiss. Packed off to the tropics with a cast-iron studio imperative ('Three good love scenes and Del Rio jumping into a flaming volcano at the finish'), Vidor returned with about thirty good love scenes, interrupted by a shark attack, a giant whirlpool and some exotic dancing devised by Busby Berkeley. Only the volcano seems inhibited. In other words this is Vidor at his most erratic, combining bathetic plotting and uninflected stereotypes with some smouldering pre-Code sexuality and the exercise, intermittently, of a powerful cinematic imagination.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.32gb\nDuration.... 01:22:42\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 528\nData Rate.... 2197kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 192kbps....
