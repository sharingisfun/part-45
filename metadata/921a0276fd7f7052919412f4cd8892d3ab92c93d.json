This is what the new movie \\&quot;21\\&quot; (with Kevin Spacey) is all about.\n\nThe MIT blackjack teams have taken millions of dollars from casinos around the world by training students to play blackjack scientifically.\n\nABC News has covered them, the History Channel made a special on them (Breaking Vegas), bestselling books have been written about them (Bringing Down the House), and Hollywood has made a movie about them (\\&quot;21\\&quot;, new movie with Kevin Spacey).\n\nBreaking Vegas (History Channel) (2004)\nThe true story of six college students who broke the bank in sin city\n\nFive days a week, they were non-descript MIT students: engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists. But on weekends, they would gather tens of thousands of dollars and jet off to Vegas and other gambling hot spots, where they would defy the odds with a sophisticated card counting scheme that won them millions at blackjack.\n\nBREAKING VEGAS goes inside the riveting story and shows us how the MIT group was founded and stayed in action for decades, eventually evolving into a full-fledged business--one with only one product, money, which it made by legally beating the casinos at their own game. Interviews with casino heads and former members of the team shed light on the opposite sides of this strange cat-and-mouse game, and we\\&amp;#039;ll see how their remarkable run finally came to an end.\n\nDVDrip\nEnglish\nNo subtitles\nDuration : 01:30:21\nResolution : 720x480\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 29.97\nBitRate : 960 Kbps\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nIf this peeks your interest in blackjack, check the torrent sites for these titles...\nBeating Blackjack With Andy Bloch\nSemyon Dukach Blackjack Science\n60 Minutes to Winning Blackjack\nCasino Verite\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:921a0276fd7f7052919412f4cd8892d3ab92c93d","amp;dn":"Breaking+Vegas+-+MIT+Students+-+21+-+Blackjack+-+DVDrip+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"921a0276fd7f7052919412f4cd8892d3ab92c93d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,26,2,118,253,127,112,82,145,148,18,244,205,136,146,211,171,146,201,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
