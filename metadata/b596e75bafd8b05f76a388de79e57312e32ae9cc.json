My commencement speech makes the rounds on various blogs and threads.  I must humbly inform many of you that despite your positive reaction to the speech, I have never actually been asked to deliver it to a graduating class --- neither middle school, high school or college.  This is the most popular commencement speech in the history of education never to be delivered at an actual graduation.\n\nHeres the history: Many years ago --- Im guessing around 1995 --- I started to get really pissed off about the fact that I had never been invited to deliver a commencement speech.  That particular year Kermit the Frog was actually invited to deliver a speech .. and I felt slighted.  So, I sat down and in about 30 minutes pounded out my own commencement speech.  This, I said, is the speech that I would deliver if anyone ever invited me; but since nobody was about to invite me here it is and you can read it for yourself.  About six months later I expanded the speech and some talk radio stories to be included in a book titled The Commencement Speech published by Longstreet Press. \nThe speech was actually delivered one time .. but not at a commencement.   A few years ago we filled up an auditorium at Kennesaw State College to give me the chance to don a robe and just Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ pretend.  We made a video of the presentation which you can see here.  And for those of you who have no idea what Im talking about, just read this.  Go for it.  I dare you.\nNow I really have no idea how the story got started that I actually delivered this speech at a commencement ceremony at my Alma Mater, Texas A&amp;M.  Theyre probably very tired of fending off that rumor in Aggieland.  I can tell you that about three or four years ago I had a conversation with Dr. Elsa Murano, then the president of A&amp;M, and she brought up the speech.  I told her I had no idea how that rumor got started, and apologized.  She then said that maybe it WAS time for me to deliver the speech at an A&amp;M graduation.  She didnt last long enough as president to extend the formal invitation though.\nSo, for now,  the Neal Boortz Commencement Speech will just have to be know as the most popular commencement speech never delivered.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b596e75bafd8b05f76a388de79e57312e32ae9cc","amp;dn":"Neal+Boortz+-+2003+-+Commencement+Speech+-+64kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b596e75bafd8b05f76a388de79e57312e32ae9cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,150,231,91,175,216,176,95,118,163,136,222,121,229,115,18,227,42,233,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
