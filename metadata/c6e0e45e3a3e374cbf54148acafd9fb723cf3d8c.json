Yes, he's a soulful Blues singer and guitar player, but also a globetrotting multi-instrumentalist, composer, producer, ethnomusicologist, musicians' advocate, and the winner of two Grammy Awards. Oh yeah, he is also a warm human being, with a great sense of humor, and he likes to fish, and smoke fine cigars! For over 40 years Taj Mahal has been playing his very own distinctive brand of Blues. On a rock solid Country-Blues foundation the artist has layers a mixture of genres, including Caribbean, Hawaiian, African, Latin, and Cuban sounds and rhythms blended with Folk, Jazz, Zydeco, Gospel, Rock, Pop, Soul, and R&amp;B. It's been said he plays Afro-Caribbean Blues, Folk-World-Blues, Hula Blues, Folk-Funk, and half a dozen other hyphenated descriptions which have attempted to describe his style, whereas in truth trying to pigeonhole the man is a futile exercise. The glue that sticks it all together is Taj's enduring interest in musical discovery, particularly in tracing American musical forms back to their roots in Africa and Europe. ~ amazon.co.uk\n\n\n1.
