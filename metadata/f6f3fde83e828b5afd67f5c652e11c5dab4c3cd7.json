Colonel Allen West, a man of unusually high integrity, \n is being attacked by the Left for his military service, during which he displayed a true act of heroism.\n A former soldier who served under West calls in to vouch for the character and integrity of the Colonel.\n Yasser Arafat should have been executed, but should Menachem Begin have been executed as well, \n as a caller suggests?\n\n\n\nPrager 20121001     02 The Ã¢â‚¬Å“RÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in S.I.X.H.I.R.B.\n\nPrager H2: Mark Taylor fills in for Dennis. Republicans need to fight against charges from the Left that \n theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re racist, which is a tactic the Left uses to discredit opponents. \n How do Republicans, especially black, Hispanic and other minority Republicans, fight it?\n These days it seems weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re unable to call a lie a lie. What is to be done about that?\n\n\n\nPrager 20121001     01 Burying the Lead\n\nPrager H1: Mark Taylor fills in for Dennis. Hugo Chavez endorses Obama. \n U.S. casualties top 2,000 in Afghanistan, yet the media is relatively silent about it.\n Would a Republican receive the same treatment? There are 20 attacks on U.S. embassies in the Middle East,\n yet thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not one story in NY Times about it. \n Mark wonders if we are in danger of losing freedom because of media bias. \n More scathing news came out on Operation Fast and Furious over the weekend. \n Why does it take a report on Univision to reveal this information to us? \n WasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t racism supposed to abate after the election of Obama? Has it?\n\n\n\n                  Download, seed, and spread the word. \n\n\nMore Stuff is here\nRush, Michael Savage, Mark Levin, Dennis Prager\nthepiratebay . se / user / CAPTAIN7SS/0/3\nbeta . demonoid . me / files / ?seeded=2&amp;uid=7492662\n\nRush Shows and Neal Boortz Shows Live are here\nthepiratebay . se / user / amuck5 /\n\nLaura Ingraham podcasts are here\nthepiratebay . se / user / freedomczar /\n\nGlenn Beck Insider podcasts are here\nthepiratebay . se / search / glenn%20beck/0/99/100\n\nPodcasts of the Rush Limbaugh Show are here (temporarily stopped uploading)\nthepiratebay . se / user / Annoyme /\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6f3fde83e828b5afd67f5c652e11c5dab4c3cd7","amp;dn":"The+Dennis+Prager+Radio+Show+OCT-01-2012+MON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6f3fde83e828b5afd67f5c652e11c5dab4c3cd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,243,253,232,62,130,139,90,253,103,245,198,82,225,28,93,171,76,60,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
