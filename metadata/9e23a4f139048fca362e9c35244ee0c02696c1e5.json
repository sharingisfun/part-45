The movie highlighted such local bands as the Flat Duo Jets and Love Tractor alongside the more famous B-52ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and R.E.M. to illustrate the depth and camaraderie of the Athens music scene. The Georgia folk artist Howard Finster shows up as well. First-time director Tony Gayton, then a recent graduate of the University of Southern CaliforniaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s film school, combines interviews with live performance footage. He keeps his camera moving freely from club stages to downtown street scenes, all of which serve to counter the dominant image of Athens as just another football town.
