He composed a kind of metal for every rockminded musicfan.\n\nThe formula is simple ... strong guitar riffs in 80's style, upgraded with the modern metalbeats and a melodic song melody with catchy tunes that stay in the head for a long time. Well considered lyrics about love, understanding and social abuses; interwoven with mystic and fantasy. The first song Rex wrote was &quot;Queen of the Night&quot; and that sounded good for a band name as well, thus Nightqueen was born.\n\nMost of the lyrics take place overnight; something that's very typical for the band. The first years were a real hell. Musicians with a touristic attitude came and left. The band reformed several times until the right line-up was found. And now Nightqueen are 5 Mystical Knights who stand for their Magical Queen. Indeed; this band is strong female fronted. Meanwhile Nightqueen achieved their first feat of arms by the release of their E.P. &quot;Inauguration&quot;. The reviews on the album were good and gives the band the strength to even do better on their full album &quot;For Queen &amp; Metal&quot; (released january 2012). Nightqueen stands for a live entertainment as powerful as their music. Hail to our Majesty the Queen, and Her Knights !\n\n\n\n\n2012 For Queen And Metal\n\n2014 rEVOLUTION\n\n\nAmong all the black and death Metal IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been spinning lately, and as much as I adore my music satanic and repulsive, you sometimes just need a bit of respite and something a touch more light-hearted to wrap your ears around. This is where Belgian crowd Nightqueen come into play with their brand of fantastic, frilly keyboard drenched power metal that contains more cheese than a Swiss fondue convention. The surprising thing is, Ã¢â‚¬Å“For Queen and MetalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is not even a style of power metal that I would consider myself my much a fan of; when I want power metal I tend to lean more towards stuff with a bit more grit and testosterone such as Hibria or Stormwarrior but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve really grown to like this album.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an album that almost sounds as if it could easily have been recorded ten to twelve years ago when this style of power metal was arguably at its pinnacle; the outlandish neoclassical bombast of acts like Rhapsody and Dark Moor are the big comparisons that come to the fore when listening to Ã¢â‚¬Å“For Queen and MetalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, much due to the heavy presence of cascading keyboard work and LauraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thickly accented vocals that really hammer down on the early Dark Moor influences. So considering the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influences, you sort of know what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to get lyrically; fluffy fantasy lore and magical themes abound. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sweet enough to make your teeth drop out. Who ever said that was such a bad thing though?\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always a lot going on throughout each song, the guitar work is superbly varied as are the keyboards which I must add are very well done. The huge backdrop of polychromatic and crystalline synth really plays on the fantasy themed sound the band are aiming for and this is none more evident than on tracks such as Ã¢â‚¬ËœLady FantasyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or Ã¢â‚¬ËœSecret of the Blind ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for example, they actually add a nice deft medieval touch to proceedings. The guitar riffing harks back to the likes of early Gamma Ray and Helloween among others while all throughout weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re treated to sweeping fret-melting neoclassical soloing that is much the hallmark of bands performing this style of music.\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no doubt that the first half of the album is certainly the stronger of Ã¢â‚¬Å“For Queen and MetalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not saying the latter half is weak, just not as flat out awesome. Ã¢â‚¬Å“NightfallÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mystical NightsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ would be my pick of the bunch along with the Priest-esque fist clencher Ã¢â‚¬Å“Screaming for MercyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The former two especially have some great choruses and vocal lines by Laura, and yes her accent may put some off but I find a certain charm in it, she has a real powerful presence which above all is whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important, and when coupled with the driving double bass and riffing it prevents it from ever becoming too limp wristed.\n\nThe main drawbacks lie in the structure which remains pretty much the same throughout the whole release; thundering double bass, soaring vocals patterns and the exhaustive keys and soloing it does become a little one dimensional by the end. Closer Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dark FairyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ especially with its cringe worthy intro just never really goes anywhere and is simply unremarkable filler while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nocturnal ThoughtsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a bit overwrought in its delivery as well at times but disregarding this Ã¢â‚¬Å“For Queen and MetalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an extremely accomplished effort of the likes that many other power metal bands could only wish they could produce in a lifetime. It may not have quite the same staying power of similar acts like Dark Moor or Dream Evil but if over the top showy power metal is your thing then by all means give this a try.\n\n\nGenre:\tPower\nSubgenre:\tSymphonic Power Metal\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t244.84 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n20 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdb3b376dea555c18235a7cf7c4d18026a72b856","amp;dn":"+Nightqueen+-+Full-Length+Discography+%282012-2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdb3b376dea555c18235a7cf7c4d18026a72b856","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,179,179,118,222,165,85,193,130,53,167,207,124,77,24,2,106,114,184,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
