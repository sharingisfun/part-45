Sweeping all the major theater awards for Best Revival of a Musical, a beloved era-defining classic is stunningly reinvented in this powerful Broadway production, featuring an explosive starring performance by Raul Esparza.

With a wise and witty Stephen Sondheim score including &quot;Another Hundred People,&quot; &quot;Side by Side by Side,&quot; &quot;The Ladies Who Lunch&quot; and &quot;Being Alive,&quot; Company offers musical comedy at its finest.\n\nActors: Raul Esparza, Angel Desai, Elizabeth Stanley, Barbara Walsh, Fred Rose\nDirectors: John Doyle\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:425d39edad3d289031b35ffc5d154cae93e93ec8","amp;dn":"Company%3A+A+Musical+Comedy+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"425d39edad3d289031b35ffc5d154cae93e93ec8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,93,57,237,173,61,40,144,49,179,95,252,93,21,76,174,147,233,62,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
