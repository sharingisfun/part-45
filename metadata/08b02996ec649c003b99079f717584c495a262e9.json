Project windows include an editing view: Click on a file in the Project list, and it immediately appears in the editing window. Projects may contain documents, folders, and Collections ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ custom groupings of documents that can be anywhere on any local or remote computer.\n\n*  Completion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ BBEdit will figure out completions for your code or text as youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re editing, either after a delay in typing, or with a keystroke (your choice). Completion can be turned on and off on a per-language basis. They can be derived from a variety of sources, including (but not limited to) Clippings, language-specific completions, and even the system dictionary.\n\n* Edit in Results Windows and Disk Browsers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The text views in browsing windows (disk browsers, search results, syntax-check results, and similar) are now editable; rather than having to open a file into a new window from such a browser, you can just edit it right there in the windowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lower pane.\n\n* Integration with MobileMe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ If you have a MobileMe account, you can keep your BBEdit preferences and your Application Support folder synchronized across machines, preserving your Text Factories, Clippings, and more.\n\n* Modeless Find/Replace Windows ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Multi-file search now has a powerful window of its very own, and both the single- and multi-file search windows are modeless, meaning you can work in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and copy from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ open text documents without having to close the search window. The search windowsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ interfaces have been greatly simplified, without sacrificing any functionality.\n\n* Character-level Find Differences ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Find Differences now uses the system ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdiffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tool for generating the difference ranges displayed in the application. The interface has also been improved, allowing you to see more granular differences, not just differences by line. Sub-line differences are visible by twisting the triangle twiddle for each line difference result.\n \n* Scratchpad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The ScratchpadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s purpose is to be a space where you can manipulate text by performing quick transforms, manual edits, or batches of copy/paste. It is ideal for quickly beating text from one source into submission before pasting it elsewhere. The Scratchpad window automatically saves its content and state, eliminating those pesky ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSave Untitled 237?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ warnings when closing a window or quitting BBEdit.\n \n* Save/Copy as Styled Text ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Save as Styled Text saves your code as an RTF file, with the same indentations and text coloring as you see in your editor window.\n \t\n* Search Xcode Projects ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ An entry in the Find windowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Source List is now populated by XcodeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Recent Projects menu. Selecting one or more Xcode projects will instruct the multi-file search to search each text file in the selected Xcode project(s).\n \t\n* Fix/ToDo Tracking ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Track your coding tasks easily: Ruby, C, Obj-C, C++, and header files will now show commented FIXME and TODO items in the function popup.\n\n* Improved Autosave ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The application automatically saves its state (open documents and windows) once per minute, so if something bad happens to your machine, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a pretty good chance that the next time you start up, things will be as they were when the event occurred.\n \n* Tab-key functionality ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The tab key can now be set to perform certain actions (in addition to its existing important-but-mundane function of indentation), including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgo to next placholder,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œindent text blocks.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n \n* Preview in MS Windows browsers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ We now recognize application stubs created by VMWare Fusion 2.0ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ feature, so that you can preview your HTML documents in Windows versions of Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Internet Explorer in Fusion.\n\n\nSystem requirements: \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mac OS X 10.4 or later (10.4.11, 10.5.8, 10.6.1 or later recommended\n* Universal application (for both Intel and PowerPC-based Macs\n\nINSTALLATION : follow the RTF\n \nDouble Click the key utility and then the console will open\nup.
