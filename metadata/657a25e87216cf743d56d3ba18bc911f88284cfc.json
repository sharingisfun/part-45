The classical treatment of balances in the available literature is complemented in the following areas: - systematic analysis of large systems by Graph theory - comprehensive thermodynamic analysis (entropy and availability) - balancing on the basis of measured plant data (data reconciliation) - measurement design and optimisation - dynamic balancing - plant-wide regular mass and energy balancing as a part of company's information system.\nThe major areas addressed are: - single- and multi-component balancing - energy balance - entropy and exergy (availability) balances - solvability of balancing problems - balancing with data reconciliation - dynamic balancing - measurement design and optimisation - regular balancing of large industrial systems.\n\nThe book is directed to chemical engineers, plant designers, technologists, information technology managers, control engineers and instrumentation engineers in process industries. Major areas of applications are process industries and energy production, such as oil refining, natural gas processing, petrochemistry, chemical industries, mineral processing and utility production and distribution systems. University students and teachers of chemical engineering and control will also find the book invaluable","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:657a25e87216cf743d56d3ba18bc911f88284cfc","amp;dn":"Material+and+Energy+Balancing+in+the+Process+Industries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"657a25e87216cf743d56d3ba18bc911f88284cfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,122,37,232,114,22,207,116,61,86,211,186,24,188,145,31,136,40,76,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
