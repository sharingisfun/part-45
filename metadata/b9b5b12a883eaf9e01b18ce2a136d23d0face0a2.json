Adguard removes all the annoying ads, blocks loading of dangerous websites, and will not allow anyone to track your activities on the Internet.\r\nWhen processing a web page, [b]Adguard does several things at once:\r\n1. Removes ads and online tracking code directly from the page.\r\n2. Checks a page against our database of phishing and malicious sites.\r\n3. Checks apps downloaded from unknown sources.\r\n\r\nWHAT'S NEW\r\n\r\nAd blocking Added \r\nAdded popular filter subscriptions\r\nNew &quot;Notification Icon&quot; setting option: &quot;Notification without icon&quot;\r\n\r\nSo now we now have 4 options:\r\n1. Default icon. Icon and notification are always visible.\r\n2. Colored icon (only in Android 4.X). Icon and notification are always visible.\r\n3. Notification without icon. Icon is not visible. Permanent notification is visible, but it has low priority, so it is semi-transparent and placed below all other notifications.\r\n4 None. No icon, no notification.\r\nMake &quot;Protection paused&quot; a permanent notification\r\nWhen Adguard pauses protection, sometimes Android may kill it's process and then do not bring it back.\r\n\r\n Add a description text for each filter\r\n Change Mb to MB in firewall data statistics\r\n &quot;Protection paused&quot; notification should not have high priority in Android 4.X\r\n Changed the way Adguard checks domain\r\n\r\n Adguard now checks if IP address is reachable before redirecting connection to a proxy\r\n &quot;Filter DNS requests&quot; feature does not work with mobile connection\r\n\r\nWe have improved &quot;Filter DNS requests&quot; feature, now it is much more reliable and works for both Wi-Fi and Mobile connection. This feature may drastically improve the battery usage, so I recommend that beta testers to try it.\r\n Tethering/hotspot is falsely detected (MIUI, Zenfone2)\r\n Fixed an issue with filtering Boat Browser and Dolphin Browser with add-ons installed\r\n Viber app compatiblity issues\r\n Added RT Software Studio's Download Manager to the browsers list\r\n Added Yandex Browser Alpha to the browsers list\r\n Periscope app incompatibility\r\n\r\n Use keyboard settings to detect default language-specific filters\r\n Tethering/hotspot is falsely detected (second try)\r\n T-Mobile Wi-Fi calling issue\r\n Error while sending feedback\r\n Sites with Transfer-Encoding=chunked are broken in &quot;Simplified&quot; filtering mode\r\n Add Link Bubble Browser to the browsers list\r\n Improve release notes layout\r\n BOOT_COMPLETED Intent is not received at â€œRestartâ€ or â€œReboot&quot;\r\n Adguard requests to a backend server has wrong User-Agent field\r\n Download or upload of large files may be broken: java.net.SocketTimeoutException\r\n Add sberbank app to net exclusions\r\n UDP connection may be closed before it is actually established\r\n Compress request body when sending request to support\r\n Wi-Fi direct does not work with Adguard on Samsung devices\r\n Always return status=500 for blocked requests\r\n Foreground check does not work in Android 5.1.1+\r\n Critical Error: Deadlock caused by slow write operations\r\n Random timeout error while downloading large files\r\n Adguard breaks WebSocket protocol\r\n Wildcard's &quot;*&quot; character does not match a new line","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9b5b12a883eaf9e01b18ce2a136d23d0face0a2","amp;dn":"Adguard+Premium+v2.1.370+No+Ads.apk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9b5b12a883eaf9e01b18ce2a136d23d0face0a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,181,177,42,136,62,175,158,1,177,140,226,161,54,210,61,15,172,224,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
