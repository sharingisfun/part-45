She lived with her father on half an acre outside Philadelphia. The book was originally published in 1978.\n\nPossum Living contains information on\n\n    Raising rabbits, chickens, pigs, and goats for meat\n    Catching and cooking fish\n    Gardening\n    Preserving food\n    Making moonshine\n    Low-cost housing\n    Utilities\n    Clothing\n\nThis book does take cheap to extremes. (It reminds me of ThoreauÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Walden.) Most of us donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to live like this. But for those interested in frugality or homesteading, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty to be gleaned from these pages.\n\nIn this book you will find much practical information for saving money, but telling you how to do so isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t my only goal. Frankly, I hope to inspire you to do some independent thinking about economics as it affects the course of your individual life now and in the coming Ã¢â‚¬Å“age of shortages.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:662df579138efc1ac5205da726b0b6766b1c710d","amp;dn":"Dolly+Freed+-+Possum+Living","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"662df579138efc1ac5205da726b0b6766b1c710d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,45,245,121,19,142,252,26,197,32,93,167,38,176,182,118,107,28,113,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
