The band split up after Schuldiner's death in 2001.\n-------------------------------\nHuman is the fourth album released by Death in 1991. It marked the beginning of a major stylistic change for Death. The actual sound of the album is much more technically accomplished and progressive than Death's previous efforts. The lyrics are now more introspective and meaningful as opposed to the gore based lyrics of the band's first two albums or the social commentary on Spiritual Healing. This new style would be more and more prevalent on all following Death albums.\n--------------------------------\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Flattening of Emotions&quot; - 4:28\n   2. &quot;Suicide Machine&quot; - 4:19\n   3. &quot;Together as One&quot; - 4:06\n   4. &quot;Secret Face&quot; - 4:36\n   5. &quot;Lack of Comprehension&quot; - 3:39\n   6. &quot;See Through Dreams&quot; - 4:26\n   7. &quot;Cosmic Sea (Instrumental)&quot; - 4:23\n   8. &quot;Vacant Planets&quot; - 3:48\n---------------------------------\nCredits\n\n    * Chuck Schuldiner - guitar, producer, vocals\n    * Steve DiGiorgio - bass\n    * Paul Masvidal - guitar\n    * Sean Reinert - drums\n    * David Bett - art direction\n    * Tim Hubbard - photography\n    * Tracy Cruz - label coordination\n    * Scott Burns - producer, engineer, mixing\n    * Mike Fuller - mastering\n    * Eric Greif - management\n---------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb9df06f3c3af2f75dff75fa4d61b6d8c59b6a12","amp;dn":"Death+-+1991+-+Human+%5BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb9df06f3c3af2f75dff75fa4d61b6d8c59b6a12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,157,240,111,60,58,242,247,93,255,117,250,77,97,182,216,197,155,106,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
