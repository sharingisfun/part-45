Just ask the green plastic toy soldiers in Army Men Sarge&amp;#039;s Heroes. Day after day, they face destruction from an arsenal of dastardly weapons, ranging from rays concentrated by a magnifying glass, explosive skyrockets, spray cans and the ultimate weapon - the garbage disposal.\n\nIn this version of the popular game series, players lead Sarge through 15 missions filled with dangerous objectives, ultimately attempting to thwart General Plastro&amp;#039;s ghastly plans with his newly acquired weapons of mass destruction. Players can experience the action from &quot;our world&quot;, fighting through seven levels set in a suburban home&amp;#039;s living room, kitchen, bathroom and backyard garden. To get closer to the action, players can jump into the frontline in the &quot;plastic world&quot;, a land of mountainous terrain, arctic wastelands, forests and towns. Six multiplayer missions and a family mode allow players to recruit freedom-fighting friends of all ranks. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInfo:\n\nPublisher: 3DO\nGenre: Action\nRelease Date: Dec 15, 2000 (EU)\nESRB Descriptors: Violence \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExtract all files with latest Winrar or 7zip.\nMount or burn the img\nInstall\nPlay!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n=&gt;Thanks to that Whiskey dude&lt;=\nTested and working on both Xp and Vista.\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71aaae2a778a59c32ec173e961abe9ffc6b143d1","amp;dn":"+Army+Men+-+Sarges+Heroes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71aaae2a778a59c32ec173e961abe9ffc6b143d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,170,174,42,119,138,89,195,46,193,115,233,97,171,233,255,198,177,67,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
