Their biggest commercial hit was the brega &quot;Os Metaleiros TambÃƒÂ©m Amam&quot; (Carlos Melo/AÃƒÂ­rton Mugnaini Jr.), presented in 1985 at the Festival dos Festivais. The band was formed in 1979 as Laert Sarrumor e Os CÃƒÂºmplices, changing their name in 1980. Their first album, LÃƒÂ­ngua de trapo, was recorded in 1982. After two other ones, recorded in 1985 and 1986, they received the APCA prize (from SÃƒÂ£o Paulo&amp;#039;s Association of Art Critics). From 1987 to 1991 the group interrupted their activities, returning with Laert Sarrumor, Valmir Valentim (drums), Serginho Gama (guitar), CacÃƒÂ¡ Lima (bass), and ZÃƒÂ© Mileto (keyboards); they recorded two other albums in 1995 and 2000 and then left behind the humor niche. Their hits are &quot;Conchetta&quot; (Carlos Melo/Cassiano Roda), &quot;Amor ÃƒÂ  Vista&quot; (Laert Sarrumor), and &quot;Xingu Disco&quot; (Carlos Melo/Laert Sarrumor).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb8b055b0b8d300aa2615d575b6040d1631de22f","amp;dn":"Lingua+de+Trapo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb8b055b0b8d300aa2615d575b6040d1631de22f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,139,5,91,11,141,48,10,162,97,93,87,91,96,64,209,99,29,226,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
