Regardless, they are \nhaving a baby together, despite questioning their potential parenting abilities. They are happy that they made the decision \nto move close to Burt's parents, Jerry and Gloria Farlander, as they want to share the experience with the baby's grandparents. \nVerona's own parents died over ten years earlier, a situation about which she doesn't like to discuss. In Verona's sixth month, \nshe and Burt learn that Jerry and Gloria are moving to Antwerpen, Belgium the month before the baby is due, just because it's \nsomething they've always wanted to do. Burt and Verona don't understand what they see as Jerry and Gloria's selfishness in \nputting this move above spending time with their impending granddaughter. Being mobile people, Burt and Verona decide to move. \nAs they want to share their new family experience with people that they love, they decide to take a trans-continental trip to \nmeet with old friends and relatives. Most of them are married with children of their own, and Burt and Verona want to see where \nthey would like to live and with whom they want to share the experience.\n\n \nJohn Krasinski ...
