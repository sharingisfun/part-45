The book is written by reputed scientists and professors of both developed and developing countries namely Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, India, Kenya, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, and USA represented by almost 53 contributors. The book is organized and presented in such a form that the readers can acquire and enhance their knowledge in plant biopesticide bioresources, its application in different areas to manage pests and diseases of field crops, stored products with status of exploring in Africa, non-target effects on beneficial arthropods, control of arthropods of veterinary and vectors of communicable diseases, efficacy in controlling honeybee mite pests, prospect of applying new tools to enhance the efficacy of plant biopesticides through use of nanotechnology, most important plant derived active principle as source of biopesticides, possible mode of action of phytochemicals against arthropods, limitation, production status, consumption, formulation, registration and quality regulation of plant biopesticides and have been cited by important scientific references. Most importantly, the book also highlights a unique example for developing biopesticides based on the research on Annonaceae as potential source of plant biopesticide, exploiting phytochemicals for developing green technology for sustainable crop protection strategies to withstand climate change with example in Africa, and overview in developing insect resistance to plant biopesticides. Most of the chapter contributing authors are internationally reputed researchers and possess experiences of more than three to four decades in the area of plant biopesticides. The contributing and corresponding authors of the book - Advances in Plant Biopesticides proposed and identified by the editor (Dwijendra Singh) include distinguished professors and reputed scientists from different continents of the world namely MB Isman (Canada), Nadia Z Dimetry (Egypt), Zeaur R Khan (Kenya), John A Pickett (UK), Gadi VP Reddy (USA), S Gopalakrishnan (India), Anand Prakash (India), Chirantan Chattopadyay (India), Christos G Athanassiou (Greece), Philip C. Stevenson (UK), S Raguraman (India), S Ghosh (India), Mir S Mulla (USA), Apiwat Tawatsin (Thailand), Dwijendra Singh (India), K Sahayaraj (India), Suresh Walia (India), T Shivanandappa (India), Roman Pavela (Czeck Republic), Errol Hasan (Australia), Ayhan Gokce (Turkey), SK Raza (India), and their colleague co-contributors. This book would certainly provide the updated knowledge to global readers on plant biopesticides as one of the important reference source and would stimulate to present and future researchers, scientists, student, teachers, entrepreneurs, and government &amp; non-government policy makers interested to develop new &amp; novel environmentally safe plant biopesticides world over","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31b26f08ec90187651cb5b6eac059777d384705b","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Plant+Biopesticides","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31b26f08ec90187651cb5b6eac059777d384705b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,178,111,8,236,144,24,118,81,203,91,110,172,5,151,119,211,132,112,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
