Her indelible melodies and sharp lyrical viewpoint give The Bright Side a powerful, artistic punch. It features eleven songs that blend sumptuous folk-pop with thumping electronic beats that Meiko helped create with producers Jimmy Messer, Greg Collins and Belgian electro-pop wiz Styrofoam, known for his remixes of songs by The Postal Service and The Submarines. &quot;The new songs were all born on the guitar, but I wanted to make this record a little more lively,&quot; she says. &quot;We played around with beats and came up with something that people could move to. There is more color, layers and texture this time around - acoustic guitars, piano, strings, horns and background harmonies.&quot;\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/05/14/meiko/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/05/14/meiko/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dbe2bd874571c39bfb815accc737a9a04776003","amp;dn":"Meiko...The+Bright+Side%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dbe2bd874571c39bfb815accc737a9a04776003","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,190,43,216,116,87,28,57,191,184,21,172,204,115,122,154,4,119,96,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
