They recorded in their own progressive way some of the not very well known European horror soundtracks, and adding an epic of their own. The Mellotron can be heard all the time while guitar and keyboards show the darkness, tension and anxiety included in such tracks.\n\n&quot;Symphonic Holocaust&quot; is a true masterpiece in the progressive genre. This is an album for those looking for a subtly menacing but no less terrible beauty. If you like dark progressive rock like GOBLIN, MUSEO ROSENBACH, LANDBERK, CATHEDRAL and Italian horror movies, this is really something for you. Don&amp;#039;t listen to it with the lights out!!!\n\nDescription from: http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=672","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02480c0d5d89673af0ba32b256e9fe3d9d003ba5","amp;dn":"Morte+Macabre+-+%5B1998%5D+Symphonic+Holocaust","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02480c0d5d89673af0ba32b256e9fe3d9d003ba5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,72,12,13,93,137,103,58,240,186,50,178,86,233,254,61,157,0,59,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
