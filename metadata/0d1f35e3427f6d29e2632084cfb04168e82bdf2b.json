Longtime narrators Scott Brick and Stefan Rudnicki rub elbows with Star Trek alum Wil Wheaton and five others. The varied narrators mean that there's no common delivery style, but it's safe to say that everyone involved was having fun.&quot; (AudioFile)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d1f35e3427f6d29e2632084cfb04168e82bdf2b","amp;dn":"Audible+Rip+-+John+Scalzi%2C+et+al+-++Rip-Off+%28Unb%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d1f35e3427f6d29e2632084cfb04168e82bdf2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,31,53,227,66,127,109,41,226,99,32,132,207,176,65,104,232,43,223,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
