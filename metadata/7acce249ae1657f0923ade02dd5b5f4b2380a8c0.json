Alright what we got here is a custom made compilation Created by Me. And I Threw in 2 Extra tracks Not GM I have played this alot while completing this comp. And I like it it sounds Pretty good for a mix up of things anyway give it a try at least It dont cost to much.  What keeps it real is respect for the artist while he was alive I purchased a lot of his music starting for me at Corridors of Power in 81 or 82 so I try to get It right. So let me know if its great or even if you thought it sucked cause it will help me to determine If I try this anymore. Otherwise Im still gonna UL what I want when I want ect Seed If you like delete if you dont.
