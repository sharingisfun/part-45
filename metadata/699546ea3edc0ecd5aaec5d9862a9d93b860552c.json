If something does not changeÃ¢â‚¬â€and change soonÃ¢â‚¬â€this is almost a mathematical certainty. This book affects you also. It is not a parochial look at a trivial medical spat in the United Kingdom, but dispatches from the battlefront in a major confrontationÃ¢â‚¬â€a struggle against compromise in medicine, corruption of science, and a real and present threat to children in the interests of policy and profit. It is a story of how Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe systemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ deals with dissent among its doctors and scientists.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn the pursuit of possible links between childhood vaccines, intestinal inflammation, and neurologic injury in children, Wakefield lost his job in LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Royal Free Hospital, his country of birth, his career, and his medical license. A recent General Medical Council ruling stated that he was Ã¢â‚¬Å“dishonest, irresponsible and showed callous disregard for the distress and pain of children.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Maligned by the medical establishment and mainstream media, Wakefield endeavors to set the record straight in Callous Disregard. While explaining what really happened, he calls out the organizations and individuals that are acting not for the sake of children affected by autism, but in their own self-interests.\n\n\nAbout The Author:\nAndrew J.
