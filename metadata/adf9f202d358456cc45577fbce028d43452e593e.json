But most levels can be completed in minutes and on the fly improvisation works. Achieving the perfect planning, getting the mission done with no false steps, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a skill harder to master.\n\nChangelog: see Version.txt.\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it!  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/248610/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/248610/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adf9f202d358456cc45577fbce028d43452e593e","amp;dn":"Door+Kickers+v1.0.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adf9f202d358456cc45577fbce028d43452e593e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,249,242,2,211,88,69,108,196,85,119,251,206,2,141,67,69,46,89,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
