Another 8 wins &amp; 20 nominations\n\nStoryline\n\nA Hawaiian girl adopts an unusual pet who is actually an notorious extra-terrestrial fugitive from the law.\n\nIn a place far, far away, illegal genetic experiment #626 is detected: Ruthless scientist Dr. Jumba Jookiba has created a strong, intelligent, nearly indestructible and aggressive being with only one known weakness: The high density of his body makes it impossible for the experiment to swim in water. The scientist is sentenced to jail by the Grand Council of the Galactic Federation. The experiment is supposed to be transported to a prison asteroid, yet manages to escape Captain Gantu, who was supposed to deliver him there. With a stolen police cruiser (the red one), the destructive being races towards a little and already doomed planet: Earth. Stranded on Hawaii, experiment #626 can't actually do much harm: water all around, no big cities and two well-equipped representatives of the Galactic Federation already following close behind to catch him again. But Dr. Jookiba and the Earth expert Pleakley never could have guessed that earth girl Lilo adopts the experiment as dog...\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n\nRated PG for mild sci-fi action.\n\nTaglines:\n\nHis Name Is Stitch\n\nFormat            : Matroska at 993 Kbps\nLength            : 570 MiB for 1h 20mn 12s 722ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC\nAspect            : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : hi\n\nAudio #1          : AAC\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/84169144539971350387.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/84169144539971350387.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/65538136315792183708.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/65538136315792183708.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/11491036179385451503.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/11491036179385451503.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/62837698630795860521.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/62837698630795860521.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/66495794548219314789.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/66495794548219314789.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/91878638130639632468.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/91878638130639632468.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNote All User :\nI Have Tested This On\nThe VLC Media Player And Media Player Classic And Works Fine.\nWe hope you enjoy this release.\n\nPlease seed, and we thank you for your support.\nADD REPS IF U LIKE MY WORK\n\nYOUR REPLY APPRECIATED WITH OVER WORK SO KINDLY PLZ DO\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74933b9d61b7963efb436aa5f2071e2ec77c2abf","amp;dn":"Lilo+%26+Stitch+%282002%29+720p+HDTV+Dual+Audio+Eng-Hindi+SDR-Release+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74933b9d61b7963efb436aa5f2071e2ec77c2abf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,147,59,157,97,183,150,62,251,67,106,165,242,7,30,46,199,124,42,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
