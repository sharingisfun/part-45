This is not to be confused with the excellent series of 4 CD Juno compilations named &quot;Oh What A Feeling&quot; which are kind of the same idea except they were released every 5 years (1996, 2001, 2006). These include a lot more older music that goes back to the 1960s. These compilations can be found here:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4804627/Oh_What_a_Feeling_-_Vital_Collection_of_CDN_Music_[FLAC]_Kitlope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4804627/Oh_What_a_Feeling_-_Vital_Collection_of_CDN_Music_[FLAC]_Kitlope&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe yearly Juno awards within this torrent are the &quot;official&quot; commercial releases. Checking out ebay I saw some other Juno compilations such as some Juno Nominees discs and a &quot;20th Anniversary CD&quot; but I'm not sure how authentic they are and they were also quite expensive.\n\n\nIf anybody has any other Juno related stuff please do make available in lossless! These are some decent compilations that reflect Canadian (pop) music quite well. And just to add, if you're interested in the &quot;Top 100 Canadian Albums&quot; the torrent can be found here.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6838327/The_Top_100_Canadian_Albums_1957_-_2007_[FLAC]_-_Kitlope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6838327/The_Top_100_Canadian_Albums_1957_-_2007_[FLAC]_-_Kitlope&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEnjoy! \n\n\nKit \n\n\n\n\nPlease help seed these FLACs! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\n\nThe Juno Awards are presented annually to Canadian musical artists and bands to acknowledge their artistic and technical achievements in all aspects of music. New members of the Canadian Music Hall of Fame are also inducted as part of the awards ceremonies.\n\nWinners are currently chosen by either members of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences or a panel of experts depending on the award. In almost all of the main general categories, such as Album of the Year or Artist of the Year, nominees are determined by sales during the qualifying period; in genre-specific categories, they are determined by panel\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\n\n1970s\n\nPrior to the development of the formal Juno award ceremonies, RPM Magazine began polling its readers in 1964 to determine which artists and groups were considered the best in Canada.[2] The results of these polls were announced through RPM each December.[3]\n\nRecord label owner Stan Klees met with RPM founder Walt Grealis to plan a formal awards ceremony for the music industry. Instead of merely publishing the award results in RPM, presentations would be made at a physical venue. The first official Gold Leaf Awards ceremony took place 23 February 1970 in Toronto.\n\nRPM invited its readers later that year to suggest a new name for these awards. The name &quot;Juneau&quot; was submitted, which represented Pierre Juneau, the first head of the Canadian Radio-Television Commission. Juneau was instrumental in establishing Canadian content regulations for broadcasters, to promote Canadian artists. That name became shortened to Juno and by 1971, the awards ceremonies would be referred to as the &quot;Juno Awards&quot;.[4]\n\nFrom 1970 to 1973, winners were published in RPM prior to the awards night after which the winners were not made public until the Juno ceremonies.[5] Music industry representatives formed an advisory committee for the Junos in 1974 which became the Canadian Music Awards Association the following year. This organisation assumed full management and operation of the Juno Awards from 1977 and became the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS).[3][6]\n\nThe Junos were first televised throughout Canada in 1975 on CBC Television.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n1980s\n\nInitially, the awards were conducted during the early part of each year. In 1984, organisers postponed that year's awards until December. A late-year scheduling was maintained until January 1988 when CARAS noted the declining viewership on the Juno broadcasts and reverted to an early-year awards schedule. That year's Juno Awards were postponed until 12 March 1989, therefore leaving the 1988 calendar year without a ceremony.[8]\n\n\n\n\n1990s and 2000s\n\nIn 1996 an album called Oh What a Feeling: A Vital Collection of Canadian Music, was released as a four-CD box set to mark the 25th anniversary of the Juno Awards. It featured popular songs by Canadian artists from the 1960s to 1990s. In 2001, a second four-CD box set was released to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the awards. In 2006, a third box set was released to celebrate the 35th anniversary.\n\nBroadcast rights to the Juno Awards were transferred from CBC to CTV for the 2002 ceremonies. 2006 marked the first time the Junos were broadcast internationally through MTV2 in the United States and several affiliated MTV channels in other nations. The telecast of the 2006 Juno Awards was available to approximately 250 million people.[9]\n\nA Humanitarian Award was inaugurated in 2006. Bruce Cockburn was the first artist to be given this honour.[10]\n\nAt the 2007 ceremony, host Nelly Furtado made Juno history by being the first nominee with multiple nominations to win every award for which she was nominated, including the two most prestigious honours, Album of the Year and Artist of the Year.\n\n\n\n\nNomination process\n\nThe nominations for each year's Junos are based on an eligibility period which lasts for 13 to 14 months, ending on the mid-November prior to the awards ceremony. For example, the eligibility period of the 2010 Juno Awards was from 1 September 2008 to 13 November 2009. Music released during the eligibility period may be submitted to CARAS by musicians or their representatives, designated for the appropriate nomination categories. Nominations other than for the International Album of the Year may only be awarded to Canadians who have lived in Canada during the final six months of the eligibility period, and are deemed Canadian by birth, passport or immigration status.[12]\n\nFollowing the close of the eligibility period, CARAS conducts an initial vote by its members to establish the list of nominees in most categories. The nominees for Album of the Year and International Album of the Year are determined by sales figures. The New Artist of the Year, New Group of the Year, Rock Album of the Year and Pop Album of the Year are determined by sales in conjunction with a jury vote. The Artist of the Year and Group of the Year nominations are determined by sales and a CARAS member vote.[12]\n\nAfter the nominees list is published, another voting round is conducted to determine the winners of most categories. Voting for the Juno Fan Choice Award is open to the general public, while voting on general categories is limited to CARAS members. Winners in genre-specific or specialty categories are determined by specially-appointed CARAS juries.[12]\n\nAs of 2010, ballots are audited by accounting company PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2003 Juno Awards\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.
