But for iconoclastic New York Police detective Jeremy Fisk, it may also be a signal that there is much more to this case than the easy answer: that this is just the work of another lone terrorist.\n\nFiskÃ¢â‚¬â€from the departmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Intelligence Division, a well-funded anti-terror unit modeled upon the CIAÃ¢â‚¬â€suspects that the event might also be a warning sign that another, potentially more extraordinary scheme has been set in motion. Fluent in Arabic and the ways of his opponents, Fisk is a rule breaker who follows his gutÃ¢â‚¬â€even if it means defying those above him in the departmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s food chain. So when a passenger from the same plane, a Saudi Arabian national, disappears into the crowds of Manhattan, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to Fisk and his partner Krina Gersten to find him before the celebrations begin.\n\nWatching each new lead fizzle, chasing shadows to dead ends, Fisk and Gersten quickly realize that their opponents are smarter and more agile than any they have ever faced. Extremely clever and seemingly invisible, they are able to exploit any security weakness and anticipate FiskÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s every move. And time is running out.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published - December 26th 2012\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93e1a1bbcafd2e2833ec60196f76a8268253208a","amp;dn":"The+Intercept+by+Dick+Wolf+%28Jeremy+Fisk+01%29+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93e1a1bbcafd2e2833ec60196f76a8268253208a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,225,161,187,202,253,46,40,51,236,96,25,111,118,168,38,130,83,32,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
