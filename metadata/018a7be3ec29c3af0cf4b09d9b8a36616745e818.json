That is, banks extend credit by creating money.&quot;\n\n\n\nAny Bank loaning money is creating it out of thin air.  This means there is no consideration from the Bank from that loan.\n\nWhat that means is that for a contract to be legal there needs to be &quot;consideration&quot; from both sides i.e. I offer to pay you back from the sweat of my brow - your consideration is the money loaned - and that consideration needs to be agreed upon before the contract is legalised.\n\nIf the Bank is providing no consideration (making the money out of thin air and therefore the Bank provides nothing of substance, brings nothing to the table) then the contract is illegal.\n\nWhat this means is that from the horses mouth so to speak all Bank loans are illegal and all contracts are invalid.\n\nIf you have a Bank loan, mortgage from a Bank then feel good about this as this information is going viral.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:018a7be3ec29c3af0cf4b09d9b8a36616745e818","amp;dn":"Bank+of+England+Fuck+Up","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"018a7be3ec29c3af0cf4b09d9b8a36616745e818","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,138,123,227,236,41,195,175,12,244,176,157,155,138,54,97,103,69,232,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
