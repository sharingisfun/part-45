The structural design requirements for nuclear facilities are very unique. In no other structural system are extreme loads such as tornadoes, missile and loud interaction, earthquake effects typical in excess of any recorded historical data at a site, and postulated system accident at very low probability range explicitly, considered in design. It covers the whole spectrum of extreme load which has to be considered in the structural design of nuclear facilities and reactor buildings, the safety criteria, the structural design, the analysis of containment. Test case studies are given in a comprehensive treatment. Each major section contains a full explanation which allows the book to be used by students and practicing engineers, particularly those facing formidable task of having to design complicated building structures with unusual boundary conditions.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 913 pages\n# Publisher: Springer; 2011 edition (August 18, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 364212559X\n# ISBN-13: 978-3642125591","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99d0432a60920f442db9c464748a5f6949f1acc5","amp;dn":"Structures+for+Nuclear+Facilities+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99d0432a60920f442db9c464748a5f6949f1acc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,208,67,42,96,146,15,68,45,185,196,100,116,138,95,105,73,241,172,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
