And now, in a rare departure from their usual\r\nheads-down and boogie approach, they've gone acoustic!\r\n\r\nAutumn 2014 saw the release of their 31st studio album and, in a complete departure from\r\ntheir usual rock sound, they transformed many of their legendary songs into acoustic\r\nstripped-down versions. To celebrate this unique enterprise, they then performed many of\r\nthe songs live at north London's legendary Roundhouse. Sitting down!\r\n\r\nThis concert features many of their classic tracks including Pictures of Matchstick Men\r\nDown Down, What You're Proposing, Whatever You Want, Marguerita Time, Rockin' All Over\r\nthe World and many more, performed with a string section, percussion, accordion, backing\r\nvocals and a front line of five acoustic guitars. Throughout the show Francis and Rick\r\nreminisce about taking this bold step and remind us of some of the stories behind some\r\nof their classic songs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCREENS\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/02049207513552722569.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/59494350967889841938.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/09343532011783221589.png\r\n\r\nFORMAT:.......................: MP4\r\nFULLSIZE:.....................: 614 MiB\r\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*404=16:9\r\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\r\nAUDIO AAC:....................: 256 Kbps [stereo]\r\nCHANNELS:.....................: 2 Front: L/R\r\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\r\nVIDEO BITRATE:................: 1200 Kbps\r\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\r\nRUNTIME:......................: 58mn 38s\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95f8d12c642a20e1253d225e1fcf777356a4715b","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Status+Quo+Live+and+Acoustic+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95f8d12c642a20e1253d225e1fcf777356a4715b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,248,209,44,100,42,32,225,37,61,34,94,31,207,119,115,86,164,113,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
