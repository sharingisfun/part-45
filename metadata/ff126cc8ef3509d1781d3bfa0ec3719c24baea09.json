Jim talks about almost losing his camera in a taxi yesterday. We talk about our ancestors and daytime TV. Ant brings up how bad TruTV is. We talk about Demi Moore doing whip-its, Armie Hammer getting busted from pot, and Oscar De La Hoya. Greg Kelly from Fox 5 was accused of rape, and we listen to some of Ant's old production. We listen to a typical awful best man speech. Henry Winkler stops by to talk about his TV career and his new books. D. L. Hughley comes in to talk news, politics, and raising his son. Sam hosts After O&amp;A Live where he takes phone calls to prove someone is listening.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff126cc8ef3509d1781d3bfa0ec3719c24baea09","amp;dn":"Opie+and+Anthony-01-26-2012%2BShit+Hour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff126cc8ef3509d1781d3bfa0ec3719c24baea09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,18,108,200,239,53,9,209,120,29,59,250,14,195,113,156,36,186,234,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
