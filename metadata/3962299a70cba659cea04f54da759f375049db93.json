It was unknown whether the album name was official or not. The title of the album was later confirmed by 50 Cent in a interview with MTV News. The album was thought to be possibly released under Interscope, by a new contract of the label and the rapper; also the Interscope chairman Jimmy Iovine revealed that he wants to sign the rapper to Interscope again, and he asked label mate 50 Cent \\&quot;what can I do to sign Lloyd Banks again?\\&quot;. Banks has said that he is willing to re-sign, but only if Interscope is willing to issue an apology for \\&quot;doubting him.\\&quot; On August 13, 2010\n\n\nTHE EXPLICIT VERSION\n\n\nsorry no bonus tracks yet, but as soon as i get em, ill have them up for everyone!\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\nNo.\tTitle\t\n1.\t\\&quot;Take \\'Em to War\\&quot; (featuring Tony Yayo)\n2.\t\\&quot;Unexplainable\\&quot; (featuring Styles P)\n3.\t\\&quot;Payback (P\\'s and Q\\'s)\\&quot; (featuring 50 Cent)\t\n4.\t\\&quot;Home Sweet Home\\&quot; (featuring Pusha T)\n5.\t\\&quot;Beamer, Benz, or Bentley\\&quot; (featuring Juelz Santana)\t\n6.\t\\&quot;So Forgetful\\&quot; (featuring Ryan Leslie)\tRyan Leslie\t\n7.\t\\&quot;Father Time\\&quot;  \t \t\n8.\t\\&quot;Start It Up\\&quot; (featuring Swizz Beatz, Kanye West, Ryan Leslie &amp; Fabolous)\n9.(featuring Akon)\t \n10.\t\\&quot;On the Double\\&quot;  \n11.\t\\&quot;Any Girl\\&quot; (featuring Lloyd)\t\n12.\t\\&quot;I Don\\'t Deserve You\\&quot; (featuring Jeremih)\t\n13.\t\\&quot;Sooner or Later (Die 1 Day)\\&quot; (featuring Raekwon)\t\n\n\nAdditional info:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_for_More_2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_for_More_2&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nenjoy and seed. for more new music check out my other uploads! more new music everyday\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3962299a70cba659cea04f54da759f375049db93","amp;dn":"Lloyd+Banks+-+Hunger+for+More+2+%282010%29+%5BEXPLICIT%5D+leak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3962299a70cba659cea04f54da759f375049db93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,98,41,154,112,203,166,89,206,160,79,84,218,117,159,55,80,73,219,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
