More than 3,000 reagents, both common and exotic, comprise the exposure media.\r\n\r\nExtensive data is given for exposure conditions and results of exposure. All data are presented in a tabular format. In addition to chapters arranged by generic material, materials selection is simplified by a section that sorts the data by reagent name and ranks every material at two temperature levels. Detailed permeability data is also included.\r\n\r\nExposure environments and material are indexed by Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry number and by trade name of the material","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3537c4489bcf49658ee8404caddace99893bda85","amp;dn":"Chemical+Resistance+2nd+ed+Vol.+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3537c4489bcf49658ee8404caddace99893bda85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,55,196,72,155,207,73,101,142,232,64,76,173,218,206,153,137,59,218,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
