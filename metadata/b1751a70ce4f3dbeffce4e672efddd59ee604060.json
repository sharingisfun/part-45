Throughout their evening of conversation, arguments and spirited debate, Nikki learns things she never knew about life, the universe, and most importantly, herself.\n\nProduct Description\n===================\nThe movie version of the bestselling novel, &quot;Dinner With a Perfect Stranger&quot; by David Gregory. Capturing the book's wit, intimacy and desire to enlighten almost line for line, &quot;THE PERFECT STRANGER&quot; is a thought-provoking tale of one woman's journey through the realms of doubt and disbelief - with the most unforgettable man she would ever meet.\n\nCustomer Review 1\n=================\nThe plot is simple. A lawyer named Nikki played by Pamela Brumley gets a dinner invitation on the night her husband is going to a ball game with his friends. She believes that the invitation is really from her husband who feels bad about leaving her alone on a Friday night, so she accepts. When she arrives at the resteraunt she finds instead someone she has never seen before, a man, well dressed, who claims to be Jesus Christ. At first she thinks it's a joke and wants to leave, but hey, why give up a free meal? She goes along with his story that he is Jesus Christ and proceeds to ask him questions about everything she can think of from various religions to the creation of the universe. What follows is one of the most interesting conversations put on film.\nLet me state that I am not a born again Christian, but when I first saw this film I was glued to the TV, it is a film that makes you think. It is a film that is entertaining, it is a film that is as interesting to those of you who are not religious as to those of you who are.\n\n\n \nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)\n\nEphesians 5:11\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n                                             \n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1751a70ce4f3dbeffce4e672efddd59ee604060","amp;dn":"POtHS+3+-+Bible+-+115+-+The+Perfect+Stranger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1751a70ce4f3dbeffce4e672efddd59ee604060","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,117,26,112,206,79,61,190,255,206,78,103,46,253,221,89,238,96,64,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
