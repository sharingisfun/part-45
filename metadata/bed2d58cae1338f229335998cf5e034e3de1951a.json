Opener and titletrack ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Elephant LandsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ echoes Paul SimonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Graceland and its rhythmic pull, while flautist Nicola leads the melody with accompanying chanted male/female harmonies that add an infectious air to proceedings. A vibe which really doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seem to tire for the 60 minute run of this colourful second helping from the band.\n\nOpening up as an atmospheric, reverb laden cacaphony, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Elephant LandsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ masks itself before expanding and bleeding through genres and styles to become a wholly carnivalesque, celebratory experimental folk album. Perhaps most interesting of all however is the way in which Cocos Lovers flit from the hurried to the calm, the rhythmic to the melodic without a shadow of doubt or sense of trepidation, and the album succeeds entirely on this self assurance. Songs built upon neatly plucked banjos, winding fiddle accompaniment and boy/girl harmonies that retain a wholesome and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œin the momentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ feel throughout, make way for the lullabyish ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“YellowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, a somewhat ode to the sun, towards the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s close. In other instances ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“FortunaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½s repetitive lyrics and cyclical structure become a mantra of sorts, while even the slightly more downtempo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Love is Not Like RosesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ has an infectious undercurrent and much going on rhythmically to keep those toes tapping ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢til the album rolls to a close. While ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“BarcelonaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ begins as a lamentful string arrangement before racing away with itself; a spagetti western soundtrack with a Tarantino feel about it.\n\nCocos Lovers are a band of huge scale and huge sound whose appeal instead of being seen as a melting pot of too much choice, actually appears just the right dosage making their compositions a heady concoction of something for everyone.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[img]http://dickthespic.org/2011/11/23/cocos-lovers/[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bed2d58cae1338f229335998cf5e034e3de1951a","amp;dn":"Cocos+Lovers...Elephant+Lands%292011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bed2d58cae1338f229335998cf5e034e3de1951a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,210,213,140,174,19,56,242,41,51,89,152,207,94,3,78,61,225,149,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
