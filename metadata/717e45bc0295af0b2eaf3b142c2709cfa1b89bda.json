It peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making it the band&amp;#039;s first American Top 40 single since &quot;I Was Made For Lovin&amp;#039; You&quot; reached #11 in 1979. It was the band&amp;#039;s seventh and, to date, last Top 20 US single. The song was co-written by guitarist/vocalist Paul Stanley and American pop singer/songwriter Michael Bolton, who was then at the peak of his commercial popularity, and with whom guitarist Bruce Kulick had played previous to Kiss.\n\nMusically, &quot;Forever&quot; is a prototypical power ballad. It begins with Stanley singing over an acoustic guitar intro, with the full band coming in for the first refrain.\n\n&quot;Forever&quot; was released as a music video that received heavy airplay on MTV, attaining the #1 position on the video channel&amp;#039;s &quot;Most Requested Videos&quot; show several times. It is perhaps the most understated video Kiss has released, as it showed the band (then consisting of Stanley, Gene Simmons, Bruce Kulick and Eric Carr) playing the song in an empty room.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:717e45bc0295af0b2eaf3b142c2709cfa1b89bda","amp;dn":"Kiss+-+Forever","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"717e45bc0295af0b2eaf3b142c2709cfa1b89bda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,126,69,188,2,149,175,11,46,175,59,20,44,39,9,207,161,184,155,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
