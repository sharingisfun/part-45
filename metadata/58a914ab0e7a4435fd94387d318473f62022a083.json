Includes all stories from web and print.\n\nVol 1 - The Great Disappointment, 2011, 234 pages\n\nThe Great Disappointment collects work from Box Brown's web and print comic, Everything Dies. This first volume features the non-fiction and auto-bio stories such as: The Great Disappointment, The Great Upsucking, Alpha, Omega, Ben Died of a Train and many others. More than anything, Everything Dies' chief success is that it is an exercise in theological reverse-engineering, breaking down the unfathomable whole to better understand all of its working parts.
