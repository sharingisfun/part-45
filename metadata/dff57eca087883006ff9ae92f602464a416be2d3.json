The follow-up to Emotional Rescue, it proved to be a big critical and commercial success. A very popular album upon release, it is the last Rolling Stones album to reach the top position of the US charts, ending a string of number ones dating back to 1971's Sticky Fingers.\nTattoo You is an album primarily composed of outtakes from previous recording sessions, some dating back a decade, with new vocals and overdubs. Along with two new songs, the Rolling Stones put together this collection in order to have a new album to promote for their worldwide American Tour 1981/European Tour 1982 beginning that September.\nThe Rolling Stones' 16th studio album, released in 1981, was composed from old outtakes and unfinished tracks from the 1970s, with new vocals and overdubs. A number one hit in the US at the time, Tattoo You still sounds incredibly fresh 30 years later.\nFile Type: MP3(.mp3)        \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dff57eca087883006ff9ae92f602464a416be2d3","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+-+Tatto+You%5B.mp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dff57eca087883006ff9ae92f602464a416be2d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,245,126,202,8,120,131,0,111,249,174,146,246,2,70,74,65,107,226,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
