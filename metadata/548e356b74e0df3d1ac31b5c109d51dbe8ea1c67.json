Seeing them transported to the present has a high enjoyment factor, even beyond the &quot;fish out of water&quot; aspect, because you also have the secondary layer of their relationships with their future selves. It really all comes back to the chemistry that Bendis has found for these characters -- it's a remarkably innocent, undamaged, naÃƒÂ¯ve and optimistic mix that's just good reading.\n\nThere are some minor things that don't work so well -- like how easily young Jean seems to accept and even joke about the fact that she's dead in the future. The panels in which the &quot;little X-Men&quot; learn (via television) what Cyclops has been up to lacks in the punch it deserves -- especially when it comes to young Scott's reaction. It's one thing for Beast to tell you you're a mass murderer, but it's a whole other thing to actually witness it. However, these are small complaints; on the whole the issue is beautiful and funny, heartfelt and intriguing.
