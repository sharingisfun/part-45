This album contains the peak of the 70's psychedelia of Korea.The opening track  (Beautiful Country)' is the song which was originally forced to praise the then-military government.\nBut Shin Jung-Hyun refused to make the song like that and he made his own version which praises the beautiful country. Intro led by Kim Gi-Pyo's keyboard and Son Hak-rae's oboe emits classical magnificence and tragic beauty. After the indulging intro, Lee Tae-Hyun's bass which shows an outstanding groove develops the main theme. It could be described as an accordance amidst avant-garde discordance. There it goes, the essence of psychedelic.The title track  (It's a Lie)' is a jamming leviathan. Although this is not a live album, this song has striking improvisations.(so these things make the album like a live or jamming album) The last track (Woman in the Mist)' is also a fantastic jam. With Lee's Bass and Mun's Drum trembling on and making the rhythm tight and loose, the guitar, keyboard, oboe show the great jam. The endless flow of psychedelic jamming invites you to the state of complete absence of ego.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Jung-hyeon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Jung-hyeon&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eab6ba23e55e929b23872047225d0fb699ff6a3f","amp;dn":"Shin+Jung+Hyun+and+the+Men+-+It%27s+a+Lie+%281972%2F2005%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eab6ba23e55e929b23872047225d0fb699ff6a3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,182,186,35,229,94,146,155,35,135,32,71,34,93,15,182,153,255,106,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
