He also learned what it takes to control what happens in our dreams in a lucid dreaming workshop. He met the first ever historian of sleep and the first anthropologist to study sleep in its natural state. Jeff found out first hand what researchers are learning about what your brain has been up to while you were out.\n\n1 hour 46 minutes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca34c8e83b0b69f1691b59bb1ff591f420198316","amp;dn":"All+About+Sleep+-+CBC+Radio+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca34c8e83b0b69f1691b59bb1ff591f420198316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,52,200,232,59,11,105,241,105,27,89,187,31,245,145,244,32,25,131,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
