Also, what a treat it was to see James Gandofini, Susan Sarandon, Christopher Walken and Kate Winslet singing and dancing and making outrageous and exciting acting choices. A wonderful selection of music, a charming and literate script and consistently good performance....what else could you ask for in a movie. Watch for Elaine Stritch in a brief role that is should be required viewing for any acting student. Also loved the work of Aida Turturro. This film was a joy to watch!\n\nEnjoy \n\nLGLuX\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ef37ee6a25a12e318d98c3b487609c03e8844f7","amp;dn":"Romance.and.Cigarettes.DVDRip.Eng-LGLuX.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ef37ee6a25a12e318d98c3b487609c03e8844f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,243,126,230,162,90,18,227,24,217,140,59,72,118,9,192,62,136,68,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
