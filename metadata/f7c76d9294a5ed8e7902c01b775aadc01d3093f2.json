You aren't alone. Their debut EP came out in December and they're with a minor label, Open Your Eyes Records. I Call Fives decided to release their debut EP online, in FLAC, along with the vocal and instrumental tracks... in FLAC. Truly raising the bar for album releases the world over, one would think that First Things First would have to be flat out awful to be given away like that. Allow me to be the first to say that this could not be farther from the truth. If you're looking for fresh pop punk that doesn't skip a beat, you just found your material. Also included is their lossy-mastered sampler and high-res album art. Looks like I Call Fives has you covered. Once again, enjoy thoroughly. This album may surprise you.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n First Things First\n  (Released: 2008. Compression: FLAC Lossless.)\n   1. Ready to Go\n   2. My Last Mistake\n   3.
