The new version of Windows forces you to use apps, which take up a huge part of the menu. Whatâ€™s more, the truly necessary folders and applications are virtually inaccessible. We have been producing alternative menus for more than 10 years and have put a lot of thought into the right solution for you. Thanks to our innovative interface solutions, youâ€™ll be able to enjoy working with Windows 10.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\nOne-click launch\r\nâ€¢ This is our own one-of-a-kind feature. Start Menu 10 replaces the yellow folder icons with application icons. Clicking on the folder launches the application. To access a submenu, hover the cursor over a folder for a few seconds. For the first launch, the application launched is determined automatically.\r\n\r\nVirtual groups\r\nâ€¢ Split the contents of any folder into virtual groups without changing the location of files on disk. Virtual groups can be folded and unfolded. Thus, you can spend less time looking for things and change how information is displayed according to your circumstances.\r\n\r\nSmart list of popular apps and programs.\r\nâ€¢ This list contains frequently used applications, e.g. the applications that you launched most recently. Thanks to a smart algorithm, weâ€™ve been able to make it so the applications you use the most are always at your fingertips. This list combines both standard applications and Windows 8 apps.\r\n\r\nAccess to anywhere on your computer\r\nâ€¢ Unfortunately, in Windows 10, links to folders were removed from the system menu. You are only given a list of applications, so even getting to the control panel from the menu has become very difficult. Itâ€™s a good thing you have Start Menu 10! With our program you can configure a customized list of folders. A broad selection of 25 system folders and the ability to add your own folders or applications are what you need to tailor the menu to your individual needs.\r\n\r\nFullscreen list of application\r\nâ€¢ The Windows 10 system menu and other applications that thoughtlessly copied the Windows 7 menu force you to use a small window to select applications. Consequently, you have to constantly scroll through this list and make lots of superfluous mouse movements. We have fixed this annoyance in the interface. Folder contents make use of the entire screen and selecting an application only depends on how fast your eyes are. When combined with the â€œone-click launchâ€ feature, the results are stunning.\r\n\r\nTimer-based power management\r\nâ€¢ Without any additional applications or effort, directly from the menu you can set a timer to shut down or sleep your computer with a delay. This feature is helpful for folks who love to leave the computer on at night to work on resource-intensive tasks and those who just love to listen to music while theyâ€™re out and about.\r\n\r\nPro Version Benefits:\r\nâ€“ Single-click launch!\r\nâ€“ Assign a primary program to any folder and start it simply by clicking this folder.\r\nâ€“ Change the structure and add tabs.\r\nâ€“ Manage the Virtual Groups\r\nâ€“ Sort files by name","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76010b88f14f178451171b66c070850a72a0e426","amp;dn":"Start.Menu.10.5.85","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76010b88f14f178451171b66c070850a72a0e426","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,1,11,136,241,79,23,132,81,23,27,102,192,112,133,10,114,160,228,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
