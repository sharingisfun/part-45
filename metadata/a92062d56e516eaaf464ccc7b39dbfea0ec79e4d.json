As her pheromones spread through the building, it looks like Ivy will win the bet. However, when the Joker finally appears on the scene, he murmurs about how much he loves Harley; Ivy has lost the bet as Joker thought he was kissing someone else. Later, Harley pays off The Ventriloquist, the real power behind Joker's sweet nothings.\n\nBatman Black &amp; White Volume 3 (Punchline):\nTold silently, Harley Quinn attempts to trick another criminal out of their ill-gotten gains by inspiring the fear of Batman in them. Her attempts to mimic the Caped Crusader, however, cannot match up to the man himself.\n\n\nPlz Seed!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a92062d56e516eaaf464ccc7b39dbfea0ec79e4d","amp;dn":"Harley+Quinn+In+Batman+Gotham+Knights","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a92062d56e516eaaf464ccc7b39dbfea0ec79e4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,32,98,213,110,81,110,170,244,100,204,199,179,157,191,234,14,199,158,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
