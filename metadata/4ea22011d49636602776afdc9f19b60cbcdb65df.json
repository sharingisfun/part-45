Hearing it downmixed to stereo without surround sound on Foobar2000, I was absolutely stunned at how every little element jumped out at me on each song - better than any version I had ever heard. I decided earlier today to convert the Ac3 files into WAV and then FLAC with the help of a tool called PX3Convert, so I've uploaded these excellent sounding -- STEREO -- FLACs onto PirateBay to share this album as it was meant to be heard on the SACD. I've also included the original AC3 files that I discovered on SLSK.\n\nFurther, other than an avid NIN fan, I happen to be a gay rapper, responsible for that remix of Came Back Haunted (which I admit wasn't to my liking - nor anybody else's, so I've included a link to my good stuff on Datpiff.com.)\n\nEnjoy these incredible sounding FLACs of one of the best NIN albums!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ea22011d49636602776afdc9f19b60cbcdb65df","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+The+Downward+Spiral+SACD+FLAC+-+READ+INFO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ea22011d49636602776afdc9f19b60cbcdb65df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,162,32,17,212,150,54,96,39,118,175,220,159,25,182,12,188,219,101,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
