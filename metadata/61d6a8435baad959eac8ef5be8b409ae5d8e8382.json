No one would ever suspect that local barber Dexter Miles would be a cold-blooded killer, but when he overhears the sheriff mention that the body of Lucy Waters has been discovered, Dexter quickly realizes that his dark secret is about to break wide open. Having only murdered her a few days prior, Dexter had hoped the authorities would not find her body until the spring thaw. As big-city detectives descend on the town to investigate the murder, Dexter once again feels the thrill of the kill. \n\n\nplease seed and comment \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61d6a8435baad959eac8ef5be8b409ae5d8e8382","amp;dn":"The+Barber+2002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61d6a8435baad959eac8ef5be8b409ae5d8e8382","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,214,168,67,91,170,217,89,234,200,239,91,232,180,9,174,93,142,131,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
