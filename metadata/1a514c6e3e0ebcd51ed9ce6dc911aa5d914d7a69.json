We talk about climate change and dealing with death as a kid. Mitt Romney flubbed and said he didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t care about poor people and a guy calls in and gets pulled over.\n\nRich Vos comes by and gets in to an argument with Jim about Jim paying Bonnie for some work, and Jim sleeping with his ex-wife. Opie talks about his dinner with Vos in Atlantic City. Vos says he is afraid of the pythons in Florida. We listen to the Groundhog announcement, and Vos singing. Dr. Steve sent in a worst best man speech that we listen to.\n\nSam hosts After O&amp;A Live where he talks to Roland and Troy about their new friendship.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a514c6e3e0ebcd51ed9ce6dc911aa5d914d7a69","amp;dn":"Opie+and+Anthony-02-02-2012%2BShit+Hour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a514c6e3e0ebcd51ed9ce6dc911aa5d914d7a69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,81,76,110,62,14,188,213,30,217,206,109,201,17,170,93,145,77,122,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
