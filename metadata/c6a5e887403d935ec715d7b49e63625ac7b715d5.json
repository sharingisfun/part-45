During this time he has produced six major concept works and thirteen solo albums. He has performed extensively in the United Kingdom, Israel, the United States, Australia, and throughout Europe, and has had many TV and radio performances worldwide.\n\nJune 1995 saw the premier release of Adrian's major, two album concept work 'City of Peace'. The work explores the Jewish roots of the Christian faith, drawing on poems written by Jewish authors spanning from six thousand years ago to the present day. City of Peace also comes as a climax to eleven years of searching and discovery that began with a journey into the lives of Jewish men, women, and children caught up in the Nazi Holocaust.\n\nIn Him,\nTorrentTracts, May 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6a5e887403d935ec715d7b49e63625ac7b715d5","amp;dn":"Adrian+Snell+Discography+1975-2000+%2826+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6a5e887403d935ec715d7b49e63625ac7b715d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,165,232,135,64,61,147,94,199,21,215,180,158,99,98,90,199,183,21,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
