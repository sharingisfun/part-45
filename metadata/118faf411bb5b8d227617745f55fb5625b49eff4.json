Very strange. It's my story.&quot;\nTo everyone at Meridian High School, Michael Vey is an ordinary 14-year-old. In fact, the only thing that seems to set him apart is the fact that he has Tourette's syndrome. But Michael is anything but ordinary. Michael has special powers. Electric powers.\nMichael thinks he's unique until he discovers that a cheerleader named Taylor also has special powers. With the help of Michael's friend, Ostin, the three of them set out to discover how Michael and Taylor ended up this way, but their investigation brings them to the attention of a powerful group who wants to control the electric children - and through them, the world. Michael will have to rely on his wits, powers, and friends if he's to survive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:118faf411bb5b8d227617745f55fb5625b49eff4","amp;dn":"Michael+Vey+-+The+Prisoner+of+Cell+25","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"118faf411bb5b8d227617745f55fb5625b49eff4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,143,175,65,27,181,184,210,39,97,119,69,245,95,181,98,91,73,239,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
