The technical quality is poor, as this is a copy of a copy of a copy, but it is a brilliant performance which sports many great singers now forgotten. I consider it to be far superior musically to Gene Kelly's version, which while visually beautiful, was not produced by a musician. This is a piece of history that Mr. Goulet himself didn't even know had been preserved outside of one copy in a museum, and now you can watch it. This is in 9 pieces because I got this off YouTube. I downloaded it from YouTube at the best quality possible, and here it is for you to enjoy. This has not been on YouTube for some time now. Remember why Mr. Goulet was so beloved!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69b52c3d36fe0ef2b8cdda5c01ab57d63bdc8bbe","amp;dn":"Brigadoon-Robert+Goulet+1966","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69b52c3d36fe0ef2b8cdda5c01ab57d63bdc8bbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,181,44,61,54,254,14,242,184,205,218,92,1,171,87,214,59,220,139,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
