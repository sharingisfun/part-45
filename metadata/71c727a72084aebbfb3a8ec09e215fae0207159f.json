The album was released on 22 March 1982 in the United States and the following day in the United Kingdom - nearly simultaneously with the theatrical re-release of the film, A Hard Day's Night, which had been &quot;cleaned&quot; and re-edited with stereo Dolby sound. Reel Music cracked the U.S. Billboard Top 20, peaking at No. 19. The album was released by Capitol Records in the United States (catalogue number SV 12199) and Parlophone in the United Kingdom (PCS 7218). In New Zealand this LP was released on the Parlophone label (PCS 7218) and the inner sleeve and booklet were imported from the U.S. It was the first Beatles album released after John Lennon's death.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;\n    &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot;\n    &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot;\n    &quot;And I Love Her&quot;\n    &quot;Help!&quot;\n    &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot;\n    &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;\n    &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;\n    &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;\n    &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;\n    &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;\n    &quot;Let It Be&quot;\n    &quot;Get Back&quot;\n    &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71c727a72084aebbfb3a8ec09e215fae0207159f","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Reel+Music+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71c727a72084aebbfb3a8ec09e215fae0207159f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,199,39,167,32,132,174,187,251,58,142,192,158,33,95,174,2,7,21,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
