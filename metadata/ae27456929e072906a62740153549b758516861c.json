Exploring the \nunderworld of the city's skid row, Rogosin developed his signature \nstyle. After months of drinking with men he met on the Bowery, \nRogosin worked with his buddies to write a screenplay that reflected \ntheir lives-and then cast them as themselves. This technique of \nmaking films &quot;from the inside&quot; allowed Rogosin to film ordinary \npeople caught up in universal problems. His films explored \nalcoholism, homelessness, racial discrimination, war, labor conflict, \nand poverty with great compassion and honesty. On the Bowery \nchronicles three days in the drinking life of Ray Salyer, a part-time \nrailroad worker adrift on New York's skid row.\nWhen the film opened it 1956, it exploded on the screen, burning away \nyears of Hollywood artifice, jump-starting the post-war American \nindependent film movement and earning an Oscar nomination.\nGOOD TIMES, WONDERFUL TIMES was Rogosin's powerful response to \nmilitarism and fascism. For two years, Rogosin traveled to twelve \ncountries, amassing footage of war atrocities from national archives. \nHe then interspersed these harrowing images with scenes of a London \ncocktail party's inane chatter. Good Times, Wonderful Times, released \nat the height of the Vietnam conflict, became one of the great \nantiwar films of the era.\n\nFormat: NTSC\nDVD Size: 6.75 + 7.71 Gb -- Exact Untouched Copy\nRuntime (total): 257 minutes\nType: Black and White\nAspect Ratio: 1.33:1\nSound (main feature): English DD2.0\nSubtitles: none\n\nSet Features\n----------------\nDisc One: Good Times, Wonderful Times\n----------------\n# Out (25:37): Rogosin's documentary short, produced for the United \nNations, depicting the plight of refugees fleeing the Soviet \nrepression of the Hungarian uprising in 1956.\n# Man's Peril: The Making of Good Times, Wonderful Times (24:17). \n# Credits.\n\nDisc Two: On the Bowery\n----------------\n# Introduction by Martin Scorsese (3:11).\n# Street of Forgotten Men (1933) (2:28): A Depression-era newsreel \nshort, complete with sensationalistic narration whose tone and style \nare the polar opposite of Rogosin's approach.\n# Bowery Men's Shelter (1972) (10:34): A portrait of the New York \nCity Men's Shelter and its inhabitants, made as the City was heading \ntoward economic collapse.\n# The Perfect Team (2009) (46:33): This documentary by Rogosin's son, \nMichael, provides a comprehensive account of the making of On the \nBowery and its reception, using contemporary sources.\n# A Walk Through the Bowery (2009) (11:05): Produced and directed by \nMichael Rogosin, this documentary short contrasts the Bowery today \nwith images from On the Bowery.\n# On the Bowery Theatrical Trailer (2010) (2:13).\n# Credits.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae27456929e072906a62740153549b758516861c","amp;dn":"The+Films+of+Lionel+Rogosin+1956-1966+2+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae27456929e072906a62740153549b758516861c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,39,69,105,41,224,114,144,106,98,116,1,83,84,155,117,133,22,134,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
