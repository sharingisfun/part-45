These days I find the production values to be a bit lacking, \nwith poor edits and other sound issues that would not make it to a major commercial release in this day and age.   Still \nthough, the performances are quite energetic and there is certainly something to be said for a live album that (presumably)\nhas no overdubs.   For example, it would have been relatively easy to trim the &quot;false end&quot; from the Rockpile/Plant track, but \nwhy?
