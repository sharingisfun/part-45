This book has been BANNED by the Liberal Left who wants to rewrite history.\n\nRead the book for yourself, study the thousands of footnotes and bibliography, and read the TRUTH in Thomas Jefferson's Own Words!\n\nThis is the book that became a National Best Seller and was quickly banned by the Left because FACTS get in the way of the left's agenda.\n\nTHE TRUTH HAS NO AGENDA\n\nRead this book, and if you like it - send a donation to WallBuilders.Com - and support David Barton as he makes sure that the FACTS are what the Truth is built upon!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e194d2fb367bfa27d0b2856d49a5513dfd28e7b","amp;dn":"The+Jefferson+Lies+by+David+Barton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e194d2fb367bfa27d0b2856d49a5513dfd28e7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,25,77,47,179,103,191,162,125,11,40,86,212,154,85,19,223,210,142,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
