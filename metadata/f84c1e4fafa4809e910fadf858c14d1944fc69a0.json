Have fun!\n\n\nThis launcher is a version of the 13w16a launcher that came out on 04.18.2013, but allows non-premium users to download\nthe latest version of minecraft and play the game with the username they want.\n\nThe original launcher allows you to choose and download the minecraft version you want (from 13w16a snapshot), then play it.\n\n- Enter only the username, no password required\n- Username used in the game (not Player857 or anything else)\n- Detect and download the latest version\n- Skin and premium-only servers are not accessible. (and won't be until the end of times)\n\n\nMade by decompilating the downloaded launcher, then recompiling with minor changes on the ui and authentification system.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f84c1e4fafa4809e910fadf858c14d1944fc69a0","amp;dn":"Minecraft+13w16a+Launcher+-+For+non-premium+users","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f84c1e4fafa4809e910fadf858c14d1944fc69a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,76,30,79,175,164,128,158,145,15,173,248,88,193,77,25,68,252,105,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
