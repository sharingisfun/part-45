Therefore, when you find an artist that is relevant and capable of joining that ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lite company, you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help but take notice.\n\nConsider this as your formal introduction to ESTELLINE. \n\nInitially a lone endeavor by their charismatic lead singer Kenny Paul Harris, it has since evolved into a quartet and resulted in ESTELLINE, a self-titled debut full-length that is distinctive and captivating.\n\nFor Harris, this album is more than just a collection of songs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they are a form of self-preservation and existence. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI write my songs with the intent of letting people into my mind, my creativity, and my craftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, says Harris with his uncanny Southern drawl. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI voice things that provoke thought and question, yet have the words to bring peace among the ignorance of the world as well as for myselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nHarrisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s approach resonates throughout the record. From the cinematic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHopefully, MaybeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to the delicate nature of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Not LeavingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ESTELLINEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S sense of charm and nostalgia is evident in spite of their relative young age. \n\nEven more apparent is their potential of becoming one of TexasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ESTELLINE is rewriting the soundscapes of West Texas. \n\nESTELLINE is scheduled for a summer release and a regional tour to support the release will be announced shortly.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\n[img]http://www.hotimg.com/direct/CAWuxEb.gif[/img]\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/11/05/estelline/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df80ff6d77541fe6893fa6dea5362331e1554f7a","amp;dn":"Estelline...Estelline%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df80ff6d77541fe6893fa6dea5362331e1554f7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,128,255,109,119,84,31,230,137,63,166,222,165,54,35,49,225,85,79,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
