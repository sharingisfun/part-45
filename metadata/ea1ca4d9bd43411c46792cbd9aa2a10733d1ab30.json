No sophomore slump for this pair, Invisible is, if anything, an even stronger set. The entire album has a lovely understated simplicity about it, belied by the symphonic arrangements of many of the songs. Like a spring breeze gusting through an airy room, there's a warmth and lightness to the sound that creates the delicate moods that define the group's oeuvre. But Blackheart bear no relationship to the likes of the Cocteau Twins, although Mostyn's occasionally breathy delivery conjures up a similar dreamy mood. She's at her best belting out a song, as she does on the powerful &quot;Farewell.&quot; From quavering nightingale to sweet chanteuse, the singer has a wonderfully diverse stylistic palette, ably supported by Pilkington's warmer tones. The soaring &quot;Wednesday Afternoon&quot; is the pick to hit, although the propulsive &quot;The Sky and I,&quot; the Celtic-flavored &quot;Lochgelly Lives,&quot; the yearning &quot;Are You Coming Home,&quot; emotion packed &quot;Thank God You Found Me,&quot; and the upbeat, uptempo &quot;The Town of Maybe&quot; are all equally memorable. Vivid imagery, excellent storytelling lyrics, and thoughtful themes are what set Blackheart apart from the rest of the folkie-pop pack, putting this pair at the top of the acoustic class. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/05/10/blackheart/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea1ca4d9bd43411c46792cbd9aa2a10733d1ab30","amp;dn":"Blackheart...Invisible%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea1ca4d9bd43411c46792cbd9aa2a10733d1ab30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,28,164,217,189,67,65,28,70,121,44,189,154,162,161,7,51,209,171,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
