There they meet the owner, Harry Thoreau, with whom Julian attempted to rob a bank three years before. It is revealed that Julian is an escaped convict who has returned to get his share of the take and reclaim his former girlfriend Lucille, who is working as a lounge singer at her boyfriend's casino. While Julian endeavors to realize his goal, Destiny frequently appears to guide him and the others along their proper paths. ~ Sandra Brennan, Rovi\n\nR, 1 hr. 41 min.\n\n\n\nAudio 1 : Hungarian\nAudio 2 : English\n\nMovie Info : Xvid Mpeg4  720 x 576, 25 Fps, 1.7 Mbps\n\t\t\n\nIMDB : &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112854/?ref_=sr_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112854/?ref_=sr_1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8ac258eaff96e2747d72bd3dd01a82ab6c3a83a","amp;dn":"Destiny+Turns+On+The+Radio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8ac258eaff96e2747d72bd3dd01a82ab6c3a83a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,172,37,142,175,249,110,39,71,215,43,211,221,1,168,42,182,195,168,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
