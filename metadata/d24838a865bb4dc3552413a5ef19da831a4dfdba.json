Plans for an American release by Imago Records\n(who issued lead single there) fell through, and the release never\ntook place. According to one of the album's songwriters and producers\nSteve Anderson, the album has sold 2 million copies worldwide. However\nofficial press releases recognise 500,000 sales worldwide. In May 2003\nthe album was remastered, complete with a bonus disc filled mostly\nwith remixes.\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n  01 - Confide In Me [05:51]\n  02 - Surrender [04:25]\n  03 - If I Was Your Lover [[04:45]\n  04 - Where Is The Feeling [06:58]\n  05 - Put Yourself In My Place [04:54]\n  06 - Dangerous Game [05:30]\n  07 - Automatic Love [04:45]\n  08 - Where Has The Love Gone [07:46]\n  09 - Falling [06:43]\n  10 - Time Will Pass You By  [05:26]\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: Kylie Minogue\nGenre: Pop / pop rock / electronic\nAlbum Release Year: 1994\nNumber of Tracks: 10\nTotal Duration: 57 Minutes\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\nCodec Version: libFLAC 1.2.1\nEncoding Bit Rate: 941 kbps (Average Bit Rate)\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Source: Original CD Release\nConverter: EAC V1.0 beta 3\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\nIncluded Artwork: (Embedded Artwork Within FLAC Files)\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\nAdditional Files: CUE Sheet, Log Sheet, MD5, FFP, and M3U\nTotal File Size: 385 MB\n\n\n\nPLEASE SEED  -  PLEASE SHARE  -  PLEASE UPLOAD\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d24838a865bb4dc3552413a5ef19da831a4dfdba","amp;dn":"Kylie+Minogue+-+Kylie+Minogue+1994+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d24838a865bb4dc3552413a5ef19da831a4dfdba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,72,56,168,101,187,77,195,85,36,19,165,239,25,218,131,26,77,253,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
