Drawing together the various dimensions of sustainability ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ economic, social, transport, energy and ecological ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the book examines their relationships both to each other and to urban form.\n\nThe book investigates the sustainability dimensions of cities through a series of projects based on a common list of elements of urban form, and which draw on the consortiumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s latest research to review the sustainability issues of each dimension. The elements of urban form include density, land use, location, accessibility, transport infrastructure and characteristics of the built environment. The book also addresses issues such as adapting cities, psychological and ecological benefits of green space and sustainable lifestyles, each presenting a critical review of the relevant literature followed by an empirical analysis presenting the key results.\n\nBased on studies across five UK cities, the book draws out findings of relevance to sustainable cities worldwide. As well as an invaluable reference to researchers in sustainable planning and urban design, the book will provide a useful text for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses and for policy makers dealing with these issues.\n\nThe CityForm consortium is a multi-disciplinary group of researchers from five universities funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council from 2003-07.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f1604a2d4e3c27c56d0c2de45ca940bead87ee4","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2011%5D+Dimensions+of+the+Sustainable+City+%28Future+City%2C+Vo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f1604a2d4e3c27c56d0c2de45ca940bead87ee4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,22,4,162,212,227,194,124,86,208,194,222,69,202,148,11,234,216,126,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
