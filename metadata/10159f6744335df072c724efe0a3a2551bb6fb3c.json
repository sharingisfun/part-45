It starred the martial artist Bruce Lee in his second major film after The Big Boss. The film depicts a Chinese martial arts school in Shanghai International Settlement which fought against a Japanese judo school.\n\nThe film is loosely based on Chin Woo Athletic Association, the actual school from which the film took its Chinese title. The plot features the story of Chen Zhen (ÃƒÂ©Ã¢â€žÂ¢Ã‚Â³ÃƒÂ§Ã…â€œÃ…Â¸; Cantonese: Chen Jen; played by Bruce Lee), a fictional character created by director Lo Wei for the film.[2] Chen Zhen is shown as a student of the real-life martial artist Huo Yuanjia (ÃƒÂ©Ã…â€œÃ‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¥Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ§Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã‚Â²; Cantonese: Fok Yun Gap) who, after the mysterious death of Huo, fought the Hongkou Dojo of Suzuki Taro.\n\nThe film takes place in the early 20th century, after the mysterious death of Huo Yuanjia, and during the occupation of Shanghai and virtually all of coastal China by several foreign countries, including Japan. It is about a Chinese Martial Arts school whose master (Huo) was recently killed by men associated with a rival Japanese Martial Arts School who continue to harass them. Chen is out to find out who is responsible for his master's death and get justice.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fulldownloadsblog.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fulldownloadsblog.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRipped by sh0ck","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10159f6744335df072c724efe0a3a2551bb6fb3c","amp;dn":"Fist+of+Fury+%5B1971%5D+DVDRiP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10159f6744335df072c724efe0a3a2551bb6fb3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,21,159,103,68,51,93,240,114,199,36,239,224,163,162,85,27,182,251,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
