(PSU) is an action role-playing video game by Sega's Sonic Team for the PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360. In Japan, it was released for the PC and PlayStation 2 on August 31, 2006, with the Xbox 360 version releasing on December 12, 2006. Its North American release was on October 24, 2006, available in all formats. The European release date was November 24.\n\nWhile Phantasy Star Universe is an action role-playing game similar to the Phantasy Star Online (PSO) games, it takes place in a (presumably) different time period and location and has many new features. Like most of the PSO titles, PSU is playable in both a persistent online network mode and a full featured single-player story mode.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53dea0a89b2e4546e2b827297268ef09b728c10d","amp;dn":"PhantasyStarUniverse-NTSC-360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53dea0a89b2e4546e2b827297268ef09b728c10d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,222,160,168,155,46,69,70,226,184,39,41,114,104,239,9,183,40,193,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
