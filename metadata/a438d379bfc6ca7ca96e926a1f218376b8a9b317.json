He now has power limited only by his imagination, but will he be able to save his friends from the powers of darkness?\n\nWritten by creator Wayne Osborne and drawn by John Byrne and published by IDW Publishing. The series was the result of a life-long comics fan living his dream by hiring a professional artist to bring his creation to life. FX was a fan-commissioned series, John Byrne made it known on his message board that he was open to full-comic commissions, at a cost of $20,000 an issue, and Osborne took him up on it, even though this was his first comic book.The production was done using the Marvel Method where the story is plotted, the art is drawn and then the script finalised because, as Byrne says, &quot;that eliminated about 90% of the mistakes newbie writers make.&quot;\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a438d379bfc6ca7ca96e926a1f218376b8a9b317","amp;dn":"FX+%28IDW%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a438d379bfc6ca7ca96e926a1f218376b8a9b317","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,56,211,121,191,198,202,124,169,110,146,106,31,33,131,118,184,169,179,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
