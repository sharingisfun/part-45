Laurel chooses Kurt Cobain because her sister, May, loved him. And he died young, just like May did. Soon, Laurel has a notebook full of letters to people like Janis Joplin, Amy Winehouse, Amelia Earhart, Heath Ledger, and more -- though she never gives a single one of them to her teacher. She writes about starting high school, navigating new friendships, falling in love for the first time, learning to live with her splintering family. And, finally, about the abuse she suffered while May was supposed to be looking out for her. Only then, once Laurel has written down the truth about what happened to herself, can she truly begin to accept what happened to May. And only when Laurel has begun to see her sister as the person she was -- lovely and amazing and deeply flawed -- can she begin to discover her own path in this stunning debut from Ava Dellaira, Love Letters to the Dead.\n\n**\n\nFrom Booklist\n\nStarred Review The assignment: write a letter to someone who is dead. Laurel falls into this classroom task deeper than she could have ever imagined, writing to deceased stars like Kurt Cobain, Amelia Earhart, Judy Garland, River Phoenix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Amy Winehouse, and others whose lives ended as abruptly as LaurelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s older sisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s did. Her methodology expands beyond simply writing to the dead. Rather, she researches each recipient, learning about their lives in order to make each letter relatable to the intended party. These quite savvy letters become LaurelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way of working through her emotions as she begins high school, makes new friends, deals with a crumbling family, falls in love, and continues to grieve for the loss of her sister. With the help of her fantasy correspondence, she is able to find common ground, express herself, and eventually discover the messages and lessons of the deceased addresseeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s livesÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as her own. Well paced and cleverly plotted, this debut uses a fresh, new voice to tell a sometimes sad, sometimes edgy, but always compelling narrative. Fans of Sarah Dessen and Jenny Han, get ready. Grades 7-10. --Jeanne Fredriksen\n\nReview\n\n&quot;Dellaira's characters are authentically conceived and beautifully drawn.&quot; - The Horn Book\n\n&quot;Best for teens who enjoyed Stephen ChboskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Perks of Being a Wallflower.&quot; - School Library Journal \n\n&quot;Laurel and her friendsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ struggles and hard-won successes are poignant, and seeing Laurel begin to forgive herself and May is extremely moving.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Publishers Weekly\n\n&quot;I simply loved this book.

As with Kurt, Janis, Amelia and the others who are gone but still somehow here, LOVE LETTERS TO THE DEAD leaves an indelible mark.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Gayle Forman, author of *If I Stay\n\n*\n\n&quot;As wondrous--and as fearless--as a shooting star.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Lauren Myracle, author, *The Winnie Years\n\n*\n\n&quot;Riveting, captivating, utterly disarming. I could not put this book down! LOVE LETTERS TO THE DEAD is like discovering a shoebox full of notes addressed to someone else. I read fast, afraid I'd be caught peeking at something I wasn't ever supposed to see.
