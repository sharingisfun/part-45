Mader (CRC, 2008).pdf\n\nISBN 978Ã¢â‚¬â€˜1Ã¢â‚¬â€˜4200Ã¢â‚¬â€˜5238Ã¢â‚¬â€˜1\n\nMajor advances, both in modeling methods and in the computing power required to make those methods viable, have led to major breakthroughs in our ability to model the performance and vulnerability of explosives and propellants. In addition, the development of proton radiography during the last decade has provided researchers with a major new experimental tool for studying explosive and shock wave physics. Problems that were once considered intractable such as the generation of water cavities, jets, and stems by explosives and projectiles have now been solved. &quot;Numerical Modeling of Explosives and Propellants, Third Edition&quot; provides a complete overview of this rapidly emerging field, covering basic reactive fluid dynamics as well as the latest and most complex methods and findings. It also describes and evaluates Russian contributions to the experimental explosive physics database, which only recently have become available","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aed8d34f047ff5a52623c2d8835d078d31393ab2","amp;dn":"Numerical+Modeling+of+Explosives+and+Propellants+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aed8d34f047ff5a52623c2d8835d078d31393ab2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,216,211,79,4,127,245,165,38,35,194,216,131,93,7,141,49,57,58,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
