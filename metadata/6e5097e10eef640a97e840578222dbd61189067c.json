In the heady and extremist Japanese art scene of the late 70s, Terayama created a number of unforgettable and highly controversial films. EMPEROR TOMATO KETCHUP is his epic, sexually revolutionary and hallucinatory work from 1972 in which &quot;magical women act as the initiatory, yet protectively maternal sexual partners to children. The children, in revolt, have condemned their parents to death for depriving them of self-expression and sexual freedom; they create a society in which fairies and sex education are equally important and literally combinable.&quot; (Amos Vogel, Film as a Subversive Art). Featuring decadent, playful and disturbing episodes which seem to be drawn from the theatrical improvisations of Terayama&amp;#039;s &quot;troupe&quot;, EMPEROR TOMATO KETCHUP is a strange and breathtaking exploration of taboo and self-determination.\n-The Blinding Light\n\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n&amp;#039;If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE&amp;#039;\n\n... simply search for &amp;#039;freakyflicks&amp;#039; \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e5097e10eef640a97e840578222dbd61189067c","amp;dn":"Shuji+Terayama+-+Emperor+Tomato+Ketchup+%281971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e5097e10eef640a97e840578222dbd61189067c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,80,151,225,14,239,100,10,151,232,64,87,130,34,219,214,17,137,6,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
