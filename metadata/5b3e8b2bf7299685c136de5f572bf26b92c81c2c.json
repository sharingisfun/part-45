But now magic is fading: Drain cleaner is cheaper than a spell, and magic carpets are used for pizza delivery. Fifteen-year-old Jennifer Strange runs Kazam, an employment agency for magiciansÃ¢â‚¬â€but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to stay in business when magic is drying up. And then the visions start, predicting the death of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last dragon at the hands of an unnamed Dragonslayer. If the visions are true, everything will change for KazamÃ¢â‚¬â€and for Jennifer.\n\n**\n\nFrom School Library Journal\n\nGr 4-8-Once magic was powerful and very useful, but as the dragons have been dying off, it has been fading. Now its powers are only used for mundane purposes such as rewiring houses or delivering pizzas by magic carpet. With the prediction of the death of the last dragon by Kazam Mystical Arts Management's seers, 15-year old foundling Jennifer Strange, the agency's acting director, is suddenly sent headlong into events that will change her life and the lives of all in the UnUnited Kingdoms. Little does she know the role she is destined to play in the dragon's death or in the coming of what is known as Big Magic. Suddenly Jennifer becomes known as the Last Dragonslayer, and is fighting off commercial endorsements and driving the armored Slayermobile while trying to avoid a war between her kingdom and the neighboring duchy. While this all seems very dark and ominous, Fforde keeps the puns and humor flowing, and populates the tale (Harcourt, 2012) with outrageous individuals and fantastic creatures. The plot is engaging, and Jennifer is a mature and well-developed character whose intelligence, strong morals, and ingenuity help her through some very difficult decisions. Elizabeth Jasicki channels the book's wittiness impeccably, and presents each character with just the right voice and accent, from polite Jennifer to the gruff, wizened Maltcassian the Dragon. Listeners will be captivated by this first title in a trilogy and will eagerly await the further adventures of Jennifer, her pet quarkbeast, and her assistant, Tiger Prawns.-MaryAnn Karre, West Middle School, Binghamton, NYÃŽÂ±(c) Copyright 2013.
