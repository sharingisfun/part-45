Everyone knows the White Stripes now, right? If you don&amp;#039;t then its a duo with Meg White and Jack White. They play some tasty hard rock, heavily blues influenced, and heavily uninfluenced by anything. Theres not much like them out there, and this album is where they&amp;#039;re at the top of their game- my personal favorite White Stripes album.  It doesn&amp;#039;t have Seven Nation Army or Icky Thump on it.  It&amp;#039;s much better than that, all the way through. This is the White Stripes before they made it big, definitely their choice material.  If you found this band recently because of Icky Thump, and you like what you heard, then get ready to have your mind blown by this awesome duo.  If you heard Icky Thump and didn&amp;#039;t like it(I didn&amp;#039;t), then theres still a good chance that you&amp;#039;ll love this album.\n\nSorry for blathering, heres the track list:\nCD: The White Stripes - De Stijl\n      2002 Rerelease YEAR: 2000\n\n01.
