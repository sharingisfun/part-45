The band was known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, country, jazz, psychedelia, space rock and gospelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and for live performances of long musical improvisation. &quot;Their music,&quot; writes Lenny Kaye, &quot;touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.&quot; The fans of the Grateful Dead, some of whom followed the band from concert to concert for years, are known as &quot;Deadheads&quot;; they are renowned for their dedication to the band's music. Many fans referred to the band simply as &quot;the Dead&quot;. As of 2003, the remaining band members who had been touring under the name &quot;The Other Ones&quot; changed their official group name to &quot;The Dead&quot;. Deadheads continue to use that nickname to refer to all versions of the band. The Grateful Dead's musical influences varied widely; in concert recordings or on record albums one can hear psychedelic rock, blues, rock and roll, country-western, bluegrass, country-rock, and improvisational jazz. These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead &quot;the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world.&quot; They were ranked 55th in the issue &quot;The Greatest Artists of all Time&quot; by Rolling Stone magazine.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:143dedd603f6143d42e80e6653978e70256e796a","amp;dn":"The+Grateful+Dead-1974-1984","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"143dedd603f6143d42e80e6653978e70256e796a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,61,237,214,3,246,20,61,66,232,14,102,83,151,142,112,37,110,121,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
