We catalog a case history whereby a naturopathic doctor killed two of his patients on the same day. We discuss Kellogg's use of genetically modified sugar, mention some superior companies, explain how children's products are not allowed to be honestly labeled, and we report about why truthful labeling is prohibited by the F.D.A..
