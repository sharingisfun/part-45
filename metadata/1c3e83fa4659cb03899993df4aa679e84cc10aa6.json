I've uploaded an update for Vertical Drop Heroes, bringing it to version 1.0.3d. Here are the list of changes in this version:\n\n- Added the Inheritance System: the descendant of your previous hero will always appear in the lineup, until you quit the game. If you rolled a hero that you like, this is a good way to retry the same build without having to rely on random rerolls!\n- Enemy descriptions added for every enemy in the game, to give players a better idea of what each enemy does\n- 6 new music tracks, so each level now has its own unique level music\n- A new (optional) miniboss, the Demonic Rogue, will randomly appear on some levels. Does not activate until injured, and has one random hero ability. Drops a gem and 4 keys when defeated","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c3e83fa4659cb03899993df4aa679e84cc10aa6","amp;dn":"Vertical+Drop+Heroes+HD+v1.03d","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c3e83fa4659cb03899993df4aa679e84cc10aa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,62,131,250,70,89,203,3,137,153,147,223,74,166,121,232,76,193,10,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
