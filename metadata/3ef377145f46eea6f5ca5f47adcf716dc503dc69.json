In Latin, the full imperial title of Hadrian was also rendered as Tito Ael[io] Hadriano, just as it appears in ancient epigraphic records. He re-built the Pantheon and constructed the Temple of Venus and Roma. He is also known for building Hadrian's Wall, which marked the northern limit of Roman Britain. Hadrian was regarded by some as a humanist and was philhellene in most of his tastes. He is regarded as one of the Five Good Emperors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ef377145f46eea6f5ca5f47adcf716dc503dc69","amp;dn":"Hadrians+Villa+%28Art+Architecture+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ef377145f46eea6f5ca5f47adcf716dc503dc69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,243,119,20,95,70,238,166,245,202,95,71,173,207,113,109,197,3,220,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
