R and M achieve rudimentary communication with grunts and moans and &quot;Eh's&quot; and occasional near-words. As a zombie, R constantly craves human flesh, especially brains, as he is able to &quot;feel alive&quot; on the memories of their former owners. The zombies travel in packs, moving very slowly, searching for victims to feed on. While out looking for food, R and a pack of zombies find Julie Grigio and a group of her friends, who were sent out by Julie's father from a heavily-fortified, walled-off human enclave in a nearby city to recover medical supplies from abandoned buildings. R sees Julie and is drawn to her. After being shot in the chest by Julie's boyfriend, Perry, R kills Perry while Julie is distracted and eats his brain, giving R his thoughts and memories making his attraction to Julie become even stronger. He rescues Julie from the rest of the pack and takes her back to an airplane he lives in at the airport to keep her safe. The two bond, causing R to slowly begin to come to life.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d52ebf5d66441621bb15de6398a7abc686ba4664","amp;dn":"Warm+Bodies.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d52ebf5d66441621bb15de6398a7abc686ba4664","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,46,191,93,102,68,22,33,187,21,222,99,152,167,171,198,134,186,70,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
