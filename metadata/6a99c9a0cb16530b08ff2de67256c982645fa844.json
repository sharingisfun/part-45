She killed two adults and injured eight children and one police officer. Spencer showed no remorse for her crime, and her full explanation for her actions was &quot;I don't like Mondays, this livens up the day.&quot;[1] The song was first performed less than a month later at the Fox Theatre, San Diego.[2]\n\nDespite being a major hit in the United Kingdom, it only reached #73 on the Billboard Hot 100, partly due to Geldof's antagonistic attitude towards U.S. radio stations. Dovid Biren, Geldof's best friend, asked Geldof to drop these views and so[citation needed] the song was played regularly on Monday mornings by album-oriented rock format radio stations in the United States throughout the 1980s, although radio stations in San Diego still refrained from playing the track for some years in respect to local sensitivities about the shooting. The song became Number One in the UK single charts in July 1979. It was subsequently covered by Tori Amos on her 2001 album Strange Little Girls and later by G4 on their 2006 album Act Three.\n\nAt a concert in London in 1995, just before the tenth anniversary of Live Aid (during which Geldof himself performed the song in the Boomtown Rats' final major appearance), Bon Jovi covered the song after being joined on stage by Geldof at Wembley Stadium. This recorded performance features on Bon Jovi's live album One Wild Night Live 1985ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2001, as well as on the bonus 2-CD edition of These Days. Geldof himself performed an impromptu version of the song while hosting the Live 8 concert in London, on July 2, 2005.\n\nFormat                           : MPEG-PS\nFile size                        : 38.8 MiB\nDuration                         : 3mn 53s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 394 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 224 (0xE0)\nFormat                           : MPEG Video\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nDuration                         : 3mn 53s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 1 073 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 1 150 Kbps\nWidth                            : 352 pixels\nHeight                           : 288 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.424\n\nAudio\nID                               : 192 (0xC0)\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a99c9a0cb16530b08ff2de67256c982645fa844","amp;dn":"BOOMTOWN+RATS+I+DONT+LIKE+MONDAYS++MUSIC+VIDEO+CLASSICS+SHAREGO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a99c9a0cb16530b08ff2de67256c982645fa844","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,153,201,160,203,22,83,11,8,255,45,230,114,86,201,130,100,95,168,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
