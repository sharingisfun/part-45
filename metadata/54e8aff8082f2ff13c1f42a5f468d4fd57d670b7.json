Marriott (Springer, 1994).pdf\r\n\r\nLarge volume food processing and preparation operations have increased the need for improved sanitary practices from processing to consumption. This trend presents a challenge to every employee in the food processing and food prepara tion industry. Sanitation is an applied science for the attainment of hygienic conditions. Because of increased emphasis on food safety, sanitation is receiving increased attention from those in the food industry. Traditionally, inexperienced employees with few skills who have received little or no training have been delegated sanitation duties. Yet sanitation employees require intensive training. In the past, these employees, including sanitation program managers, have had only limited access to material on this subject. Technical information has been confined primarily to a limited number of training manuals provided by regulatory agen cies, industry and association manuals, and recommendations from equipment and cleaning compound firms. Most of this material lacks specific information related to the selection of appropriate cleaning methods, equipment, compounds, and sanitizers for maintaining hygienic conditions in food processing and prepara tion facilities. The purpose of this text is to provide sanitation information needed to ensure hygienic practices. Sanitation is a broad subject; thus, principles related to con tamination, cleaning compounds, sanitizers, and cleaning equipment, and specific directions for applying these principles to attain hygienic conditions in food processing and food preparation are discussed. The discussion starts with the importance of sanitation and also includes regulatory requirements and voluntary sanitation programs including additional and updated information on Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54e8aff8082f2ff13c1f42a5f468d4fd57d670b7","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Food+Sanitation+3rd+ed+-+Norman+G.+Marriott","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54e8aff8082f2ff13c1f42a5f468d4fd57d670b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,232,175,248,8,47,47,241,60,31,66,165,244,104,212,253,87,214,112,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
