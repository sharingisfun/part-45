Rather than an unwieldy dump of thousands of issues that are meticulously numbered and ordered (and whose filenames screw with modern comic reader parsers), the Chronology is presented as a series of ad-hoc collections with a simple volume ordering. I'll be releasing these in series of 10 volumes a piece.\r\n\r\nAs with previous releases of this chronology, strict chronology order has been followed as close as possible, though some flexibility and &quot;grain of salt&quot; needs to be used for proper interpretation. Books have been culled from a variety of sources and all credit goes to the original scanners/rippers\r\n\r\nNow included in all releases is a copy of the Overview and Roadmap, outlining major events and acting as a starter's guide to Superman's adventures to help new readers find jumping-on points","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a562b1d02e01029c1e444903e860cf980081b304","amp;dn":"Superman+Post-Crisis+Chronology%2C+Volumes+381-390","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a562b1d02e01029c1e444903e860cf980081b304","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,98,177,208,46,1,2,156,30,68,73,3,232,96,207,152,0,129,179,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
