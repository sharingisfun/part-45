The group's eponymous debut album was recorded in England in February of 1972 with producer Glyn Johns and released on June 17, 1972. Eagles was a breakthrough success, yielding three Top 40 singles. The first single and lead track, &quot;Take It Easy&quot;, was a song written by Glenn Frey and his neighbor and fellow country-folk rocker Jackson Browne. Browne had written the first and third verses, and the chorus, but his work on the song had stalled. After giving Frey permission to work on it, Frey added the second verse. The song reached #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and propelled the Eagles to stardom. The single was followed by the bluesy &quot;Witchy Woman&quot; and the soft country rock ballad &quot;Peaceful Easy Feeling&quot;, charting at #9 and #22 respectively.\n\nThe Eagles were a major force in popularizing the Southern California country rock sound. Rolling Stone magazine's 2003 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; ranked Eagles at number 374. In 2003, the album was ranked number 374 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nSide one\n   1. &quot;Take It Easy&quot; (Jackson Browne, Glenn Frey) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:34\n          * Lead vocal by Glenn Frey\n   2. &quot;Witchy Woman&quot; (Don Henley, Bernie Leadon) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:14\n          * Lead vocal by Don Henley\n   3. &quot;Chug All Night&quot; (Frey) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:18\n          * Lead vocal by Glenn Frey\n   4. &quot;Most of Us Are Sad&quot; (Frey) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:38\n          * Lead vocal by Randy Meisner\n   5. &quot;Nightingale&quot; (Browne) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:08\n          * Lead vocal by Don Henley\n\nSide two\n   1. &quot;Train Leaves Here This Morning&quot; (Gene Clark, Leadon) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:13\n          * Lead vocal by Bernie Leadon\n   2. &quot;Take the Devil&quot; (Randy Meisner) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:04\n          * Lead vocal by Randy Meisner\n   3. &quot;Earlybird&quot; (Leadon, Meisner) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:03\n          * Lead vocal by Bernie Leadon\n   4. &quot;Peaceful Easy Feeling&quot; (Jack Tempchin) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:20\n          * Lead vocal by Glenn Frey\n   5. &quot;Tryin'&quot; (Meisner) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:54\n          * Lead vocal by Randy Meisner\n\nPersonnel\n    * Glenn Frey Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitars, slide guitar, harmonica, keyboards, lead vocals\n    * Don Henley Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, guitar, lead vocals\n    * Bernie Leadon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar, mandolin, banjo, lead vocals\n    * Randy Meisner Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar, guitar, lead vocals\n\nSingles\n    * &quot;Take It Easy/Get You in the Mood&quot; - Asylum 11005; released May 1, 1972\n    * &quot;Witchy Woman/Early Bird&quot; - Asylum 11008; released August 1, 1972\n    * &quot;Peaceful Easy Feeling/Tryin'&quot; - Asylum 11013; released December 1, 1972\n\nCharts\n\nAlbum\nYear \tChart \tPosition\n1972 \tBillboard Pop Albums \t22\n\nSingles\nYear \tSingle \tChart \tPosition\n1972 \t&quot;Take It Easy&quot; \tBillboard Pop Singles \t12\n1972 \t&quot;Witchy Woman&quot; \tBillboard Pop Singles \t9\n1973 \t&quot;Peaceful Easy Feeling&quot; \tBillboard Pop Singles \t22\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n\nTechnical Info\n\nWarner/Rhino (UK) SD 5054 180g Vinyl\n24-96 Vinyl Rip by Dr. Robert\n\nNitty Gritty RCM 1.5\nTechnics SL-1200MK2 Turntable with KAB Fluid Damping\nOrtofon 2M Black cartridge\nPro-Ject Tube Box SE II Preamp\nTascam US-144 external USB 2.0 Audiointerface\nMonster Cable interconnects\nBias Peak LE 6 recording software\niZotope RX Advanced 1.21 for redbook conversion\nTrader's Little Helper for redbook SBE correction\n\nRCM&gt;TT &gt; Ortofon 2M Blk&gt; Tube Box preamp&gt; ADC&gt; Mac Pro Dual Xeon&gt; Peak LE @ 24/96 &gt; manual click removal\nanalyze (no clipping, no DC Bias offset) &gt; Click Repair 3.02 used in Manual Mode- 20 Rev, Pitch Protection, X2 &gt; split into individual Tracks &gt; FLAC encoded XLD 20090320\n\nAll de-clicking done visually in manual mode to preserve transients\n\nNo silence been removed, please burn gapless to match original track layout.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cc494c731f7cbdf67cf287e6c61c8404a32302f","amp;dn":"Eagles+-+Eagles+%281972%29+%7BVINYL%7D+%28Warner-Rhino+UK%29+%5B24%3A96%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cc494c731f7cbdf67cf287e6c61c8404a32302f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,196,148,199,49,247,203,223,103,207,40,126,108,97,200,64,74,50,48,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
