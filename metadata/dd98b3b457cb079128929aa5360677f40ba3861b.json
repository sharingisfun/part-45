If anyone finds any other errors please let me know.\n\nGordon Kirby is an otherwise normal guy who found he enjoyed patrolling the rooftops of his home city in a crimefighting costume (a Sears jogging suit, modified by his sister to include a hood). He's not really a superhero (though he did once stop a mugging), but he's often found himself in the right place at the right time, and been forced to act heroically. Sometimes he is hired to do good deeds. His own view of his goals is summed up by his desire &quot;To dominate the world with peace, love, and free beer.&quot; In his career he has battled an insane psychiatrist, terrorists, and even servants of the Devil.\n\nENJOY ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd98b3b457cb079128929aa5360677f40ba3861b","amp;dn":"The+Jam_Urban+Adventure+%28complete+w%2Fspecials%29-bernie+mireault","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd98b3b457cb079128929aa5360677f40ba3861b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,152,179,180,87,203,7,145,40,146,154,165,54,6,119,244,11,163,134,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
