And their music really is charming, with excellent clean vocals, great guitar riffs and solos, a rhythmic kitchen showing a good work in terms of technique and weight, and the keyboards work is lovely. And their music is not simply a mix of Heavy Metal with Power Metal aspects, but has high doses of AOR/Hard Rock touches. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s excellent.\n\nThe sound production really is on a high level, making the band sound clear and the arrangements appear, but without losing the notion that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re dealing with a Metal band.\n\nSo, you will got in love with their work listening great and perfect songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“After the RainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Living on the SunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (what great chorus), Ã¢â‚¬Å“The QuickeningÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (the great chorus and keyboards are giving a delicious taste to the music), the bold and heavier Ã¢â‚¬Å“Legions of the BraveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grinding the Bastards DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. But donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get the wrong idea: the album is wonderful from beginning to the end.\n1. \tArcturus Rising, Part 1 \t00:59 \t \n2. \tAfter the Rain \t05:32 \t \n3. \tAll or Nothing \t06:29 \t \n4. \tLiving on the Sun \t07:21 \t \n5. \tThe Quickening \t06:43 \t \n6. \tLegions of the Brave \t06:47 \t \n7. \tArcturus Rising, Part 2 \t07:03 \t \n8. \tGrinding the Bastards Down \t05:04 \t \n9. \tGoing Home \t05:53 \t \n10. \tIn Evil We Trust \t05:53 \t \n11. \tStormbringer \t05:30 \t \n12. \tThe World Burns Away \t04:37 \t \n  \t01:07:51 \t \n\nSeed it if you keep it....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cedbbfece54fc4109c4e57c1de72f64472d7cc37","amp;dn":"Ninth+Circle+-+Legions+Of+The+Brave+mp3++320k+++ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cedbbfece54fc4109c4e57c1de72f64472d7cc37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,219,191,236,229,79,196,16,156,78,87,193,222,114,246,68,114,215,204,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
