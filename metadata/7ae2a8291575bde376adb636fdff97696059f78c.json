Spin the model or switch into 'walk mode' for Quake-style control.\nRealtime mirror for symmetrical work\nSix boolean operations: Subtract, Intersect, Union, Cut-Away, Knife, Kife and Cut-away\nManipulate one or more vertices\nsnap together\nsnap to grid\nsmooth shape\nalign to axis\ncreate new surfaces from\ncreate a 2D mesh using\nManipulate one or more surfaces/polygons\ninsert/remove vertices\nslice across surface/s\nmake holes\nspike\nspline\nbevel\ntriangulate\nflip\ndivide\ncombine\nflatten\ncalculate surface-area\nchange vertex order\ncut away into a new object\nManipulate one or more objects\nextrude along a path (line)\nRevolve\nmirror\nreduce polygons\nmerge surfaces/vertices into a single object\nfragment/explode - split surfaces into individual objects\nalign to each other\nreplicate\nObject crease angle support - smooth shapes with sharp edges without the hard work\nTexture mapping support with switchable real-time rendering.\nSwitch a view into 'Inspect' mode to instantly see the 'clean' image\nAnti-alias 3D views for smoother images\nSnapshot images into the system clipboard for pasting into other software (Windows, Mac)\nCreate new surfaces/objects around any selection (Convex hull)\nObjects can be named and searched for within a scene\nAttach URLs to objects for use in VRML files\nAttach string data to objects can be used as special directives for POV or renderman, or custom software\nNavigate/Zoom around the 2D views with cursor keys and other single key presses\nHierarchical view window with drag/drop and locking/ hiding controls\nHide/unhide objects for easier/faster editing of complicated scenes\nHeadlight and up to 7 other positionable lights\n24-bit colour palette with adjustable diffuse; ambient; emissive; specular; shininess and transparency\nAdjustable 2D and 3D grid guide lines with grid-snap function\nDistances, positions and sizes of selected objects displayed on screen\nScale a selection to a specific size\nConfigurable to use external renderers such as Povray ( Tools-&gt;Render )\nFlip a selection about X, Y or Z axis\nRemove duplicate vertices and surfaces ('optimize')\n3D mouse (3Dconnexion) support e.g. SpaceNavigator\nMulti-platform program - Windows, Linux and Mac OS X\nFast and memory efficient, compact program binary.\nSoftware development kit and plugin interface.\n\nRequirements:\n\nWindows or Linux x86 or Mac OS X 10.4 (or later)\n256 MB RAM minimum\n20 MB hard disk space\npreferable, but not necessary - 3D accelerated video card with OpenGL drivers\nmonitor resolution 1024x768, or higher\n\nHow to Install:\n\n1.
