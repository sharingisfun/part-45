Hits include &quot;Ballad of Dwight Fry&quot;, &quot;Is It My Body&quot;, and one of Cooper's trademark songs, &quot;I'm Eighteen&quot;. After two failed albums, this was the album that brought the Alice Cooper band into the mainstream. Much credit is generally given to producer Bob Ezrin, protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© of record giant Jack Richardson, for cleaning up the band's sound with fresh ideas and making it more accessible, most notably on the track, &quot;I'm Eighteen&quot;. It originally was a much longer song, and in more of a psychedelic vein like the band's first two albums, which contained several longer songs.\n\nThe album cover caused much controversy at the time of its release. Early pressings show Cooper's thumb sticking out of his pants, thus giving the illusion of a penis (see cover photo). This led Warner Brothers to censor it (four different versions of the front cover exist on LP). Alice Cooper's thumb along with his right arm is clearly airbrushed out on censored versions. The original CD release uses the most common censored LP cover for the booklet cover.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 460 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Both &quot;Second Coming&quot; and &quot;Ballad of Dwight Fry&quot; were covered by alternative metal band The Melvins for their album Lysol. &quot;Is It My Body&quot; was covered by Sonic Youth and Emilie Autumn.\n\nThe first issue of the album was on Straight Records, a company created by Frank Zappa and manager Herb Cohen. By the time the album became a success it had already been re-issued by Warner Bros. Records, who were the original distributors of the Straight label.\n\nLove It to Death reached #35 on the Billboard albums chart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33647ece2a059d3855c0d5771aad4dcc3002c05b","amp;dn":"Love+it+to+Death+-+Alice+Cooper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33647ece2a059d3855c0d5771aad4dcc3002c05b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,100,126,206,42,5,157,56,85,192,213,119,26,173,77,204,48,2,192,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
