Ray tracks a large pack of these highly secretive predators but he has only ten days before wolves are taken off IdahoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s endangered species list and could be hunted.\n\n\n2)Bears: The pristine wilderness of British ColumbiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Pacific Coast is the only place in the world where white spirit bears can be found. There are only about 400 of these bears alive today and to find one will be a personal fi rst for Ray. Unfortunately, they live in the same territory as groups of potentially dangerous Grizzly and Black bears which makes tracking them a particularly hazardous challenge.\n\n\n3)Leopards: The ferociously hot terrain of NamibiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Central Highland Plain is home to some of the most dangerous of all predators and one of its most revered is the leopard. Ray joins a pioneering leopard research project, and uses his unique skills on a quest to find a notoriously huge dominant male leopard. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresented by: Ray Mears \n=======================\n\n\nProduced by: Mike McDowall\n==========================\n\n\n\n\nTitle................: Survival With Ray Mears\nYear.................: 2010\nGenre................: Documentary \nVideo Length.........: 00:48:09 (  ) 00:48:35 Each\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........: MPEG Layer-3 \nLanguage.............: English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.: 16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........: XviD \nVideo Resolution.....: 624x352 \nVIdeo Bitrate........: 1007 kbit/s ( ) 1017 kbits\n\n\nSubs.................: (N/A)\nFile Size:...........: 349 MB ( ) 350 MB\nFPS..................: 25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........: 2 channels\nRelease date.........: 2010\nParts................: 3 Episodes\n\n\n \n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1642599/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1642599/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1642599/episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1642599/episodes&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n    Episodes:\n    =========\n\n 1) Leopards\n 2) Bears\n 3) Wolves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e29ed2c9a2c82ac11cf6fc7202be54577e0a48a4","amp;dn":"Survival+With+Ray+Mears-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e29ed2c9a2c82ac11cf6fc7202be54577e0a48a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,158,210,201,162,200,42,193,28,246,252,114,2,190,84,87,126,10,72,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
