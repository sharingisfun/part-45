Edison and tenor saxophonist Jimmy Forrest work well together, inspiring one another with lyrical lines on the ballads like &quot;The Very Thought of You,&quot; and Edison's easygoing blues &quot;Pussy Willow,&quot; but also heat up the session with their playing on an up-tempo Basie-like blues in &quot;Nasty.&quot; Edison switches to open horn during most of the second CD. Forrest's vibrato-filled solo on &quot;Ill Wind,&quot; and Edison's memorable rendition of &quot;Baby, Won't You Please Come Home?,&quot; including both open and muted trumpet solos, are second-half highlights. Pianist Jimmy Jones, bassist Joe Benjamin, drummer Charlie Persip, and rhythm guitarist Freddie Greene make up the capable rhythm section. This reissue is a part of the Verve Elite limited-edition series with only 6,500 copies pressed. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\nThe Swinger\n01. Pussy Willow\n02. The Very Thought Of You\n03. Nasty\n04.
