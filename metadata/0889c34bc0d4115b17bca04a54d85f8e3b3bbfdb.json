(Marcel Dekker, 2003).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0-8247-0686-2\r\n\r\nDiscussing methods of enzyme purification, characterization, isolation, and identification, this book details the chemistry, behavior, and physicochemical properties of enzymes to control, enhance, or inhibit enzymatic activity for improved taste, texture, shelf-life, nutritional value, and process tolerance of foods and food products. The book covers general aspects of enzymology and the biotechnological strategies for enzyme discovery and development. It describes prototypic enzymes of the six chemical types of reactions catalyzed by enzymes, addressing what the enzymes do, their importance to feed and food production, their chemical and biological properties, and measurement of their activity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0889c34bc0d4115b17bca04a54d85f8e3b3bbfdb","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Food+Enzymology+-+John+R.+Whitaker+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0889c34bc0d4115b17bca04a54d85f8e3b3bbfdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,137,195,75,192,212,17,91,23,188,160,74,84,216,95,142,59,59,191,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
