Frank is an ex-soldier plagued by disturbing memories of an unspeakable past whose life collides with a young homeless girl which blossoms into an unlikely friendship. As the pair's relationship develops, their association is disrupted by the appearance of Lynette's psychotic drug-dealing boyfriend Danny (played by rising star Tom Sturridge, THE BOAT THAT ROCKED, ON THE ROAD). After insinuating himself into Frank's flat, it becomes apparent that things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:271367923b7e07f74772db417f1ea1bdbe6455da","amp;dn":"Junkhearts+2011+DVDRIP+AC3+XVID+FoZzYd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"271367923b7e07f74772db417f1ea1bdbe6455da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,19,103,146,59,126,7,247,71,114,219,65,127,30,161,189,190,100,85,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
