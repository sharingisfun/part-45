Just ask anyone. There is no situation I can't handle. Divorcing parents? No problem. An ex-boyfriend who wants to date Smith High School's biggest geek instead of me? Just a matter of time before I can make him see reason. At least, until my parents decide to ship me off on a study abroad trip to CambodiaÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nNow instead of being admired as the queen of the Notables, I'm stuck with a bunch of college students who don't take me seriously, and a professor who accidentally landed himself on the wrong side of a drug lord. And it's up to me to get us all out of the country alive--even the annoying jerk with the green eyes who won't stop calling me &quot;princess.&quot;\n\nOh yeah, what could possibly go wrong?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0483c61cec1fc2de4b425b8c6c166b2c42a7cd83","amp;dn":"Notable+-+Marni+Bates.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0483c61cec1fc2de4b425b8c6c166b2c42a7cd83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,131,198,28,236,31,194,222,75,66,91,140,108,22,107,44,66,167,205,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
