The band atmosphere frees up Callahan&amp;#039;s singing and the songs which verge into country music (in terms of what country once was and not what it presently is) seem far more open than previous efforts. The symbolism of the color red is a bit overdone (&quot;Blood Red Bird,&quot; &quot;Red Apples,&quot; and &quot;Red Apple Falls&quot;) and an undercurrent of overseriousness threaten to defeat the album&amp;#039;s relaxed nature. (&quot;Ex-Con&quot; loosens things considerably). The simple beauty of much of what&amp;#039;s here is quite astonishing at times. --Rob O&amp;#039;Connor\n\n\n--\n\n\nAll Files Tagged Correctly @ 192 kbps\n\n\n--\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dragcity.com/catalog/records/dc116.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dragcity.com/catalog/records/dc116.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09592586e0d827d8d63a8744693b8959561b9672","amp;dn":"Smog+-+Red+Apple+Falls+-+1997","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09592586e0d827d8d63a8744693b8959561b9672","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,89,37,134,224,216,39,216,214,58,135,68,105,59,137,89,86,27,150,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
