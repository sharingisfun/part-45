Three years passed before the British singer/rapper came out with a second album. Thankfully, she more than lived up to the tremendous promise of Raw Like Sushi on the equally magnificent and risk-taking Homebrew. Cherry shows no signs of the dreaded sophomore slump -- everything on the CD is a gem. She triumphs with a seamless and unorthodox blend of hip-hop, R&amp;B, dance music, and pop, and on &quot;Money Love&quot; and &quot;Trout,&quot; the presence of R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe brings rock to the eclectic mix. As humorous as Cherry can be, her reflections on relationships and social issues are often quite pointed. While &quot;Money Love&quot; decries the evils of materialism, the moving &quot;I Ain't Gone Under Yet&quot; describes an inner-city woman's determination not to be brought down by the poverty and drugs that surround her. And &quot;Twisted&quot; is about keeping yourself sane in a world gone insane. Unfortunately, Homebrew wasn't the commercial breakthrough Cherry was more than deserving of..\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Sassy - - - Neneh Cherry Featuring Guru\n[02] Money Love\n[03] Move With Me\n[04] I Ain't Gone Under Yet\n[05] Twisted\n[06] Buddy X\n[07] Somedays\n[08] Trout - - - Neneh Cherry Featuring Michael Stipe\n[09] Peace In Mind\n[10] Red Paint\n\nPlay Time - 00h:42m:39s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 284mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
