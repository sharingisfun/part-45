Enrique, on the other hand, runs like hell and finds safety in the basement of a nearby house, barring the door from inside. Chad follows and manages to shut himself safely inside the ground floor level and secures the building against zombie attack.\n\nOn taking stock of their respective situations, Enrique finds a ton of food and entertainment in the basement and settles in without a second thought, dining well to a constant soundtrack of Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass while poor Chad upstairs eats a can of peaches (the only food available to him) and slowly begins to starve. Refusing to die, the desperately hungry human turns to the only source of protein around - the walking dead outside...\n\nAfter finding he has a taste for the undead, the situation becomes more complicated by the return of his friend Colin as a clever, fast moving zombie who is as determined to eat his old buddy as Chad is to dine on Colinburgers tonight. The result is a hilarious slapstick battle of wits (and weapons) to see who eats whom. And what about the well-fed and comfortable Enrique downstairs, how will this affect him in his slacker hideaway?\n\n\nSorry COuld Not FInd IMDB link........","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b648c3e570873a2247adf4f7efe8cb7c2164d84","amp;dn":"Zombie+Chomp+%282003%29+Short-Film","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b648c3e570873a2247adf4f7efe8cb7c2164d84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,100,140,62,87,8,115,162,36,122,223,79,126,254,140,183,194,22,77,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
