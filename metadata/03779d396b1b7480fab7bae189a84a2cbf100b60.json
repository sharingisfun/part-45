I got this on VHS from a friend in 1992. It's a copy of a copy, so the quality isn't the best. The video doesn't show for the first five seconds, but it's okay after that. Sorry about it being so big. I converted it with Handbrake and this is what it gave me. I've included a 60 second sample so you can try it before you download it all.\n\nThere's another music video from the same group (Hyperdelic) at the Internet Archive: http://www.archive.org/details/Timothy_Leary_Archives_295\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03779d396b1b7480fab7bae189a84a2cbf100b60","amp;dn":"Hyperdelic+Video","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03779d396b1b7480fab7bae189a84a2cbf100b60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,119,157,57,107,27,116,128,250,183,186,225,137,168,74,44,191,16,11,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
