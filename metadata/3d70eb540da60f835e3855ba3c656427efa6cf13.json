This utility only synchronizes Calendar.\n\nUntil January 30 2013 you can still install and connect this utility, but Google have removed the installer from their distribution site.\n\nThis installer is for version 0.9.4.1 which is compatible with Microsoft Outlook 2010\n\nKeep in mind that after January 30 you will no longer be able to use this installer, as new connection will no longer be accepted by Google, so don't uninstall after that date, or you won't be able to get it running again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d70eb540da60f835e3855ba3c656427efa6cf13","amp;dn":"Google+Calendar+Sync+V0.9.4.1+%28Outlook+2010+compatible%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d70eb540da60f835e3855ba3c656427efa6cf13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,112,235,84,13,166,15,131,94,56,85,186,60,101,100,39,239,166,207,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
