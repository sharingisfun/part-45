As a result, a seemingly endless supply of compilations have been released since the band's split, most of them covering the same songs and few of them staying in print for verylong. Disky's BEST OF THE SPECIALS is not a perfect compilation--shockingly, it doesn't include &quot;Ghost Town&quot;, the band's biggest hit. Also, by including some rarities and lesser-known songs, it gives a fuller overview of the band than many of the more narrowly focused sets. Besides familiar hits like &quot;A Message To You Rudy&quot;, this 16-track compilation also includes comparative rarities like &quot;War Crimes&quot;, a chilling condemnation of Middle East violence, and an African-influenced version of &quot;Maggie's Farm&quot; that foreshadows Specials offshoot Fun Boy Three's uniquely percussive sound.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Rude Boys Outa Jail\n[02] A Message To You Rudy\n[03] Rat Race\n[04] Maggie's Farm\n[05] Blank Expression\n[06] Why?\n[07] I Can't Stand It\n[08] Man At C &amp; A\n[09] Do The Dog\n[10] Too Much Too Young\n[11] Monkey Man\n[12] Little Bitch\n[13] War Crimes\n[14] Nite Klub\n[15] Concrete Jungle\n[16] Enjoy Yourself (It's Later Than You Think)\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time \t- 00h:55m:34s\n\nTotal File Size \t\t- 131mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t\t- I-Tunes MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format\t\t- N / A\n\t\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Ska Reggae \n\nRelease Date\t\t- 30 September 1996\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Disky Communications EMI Records\n\nArtists WebSite\t\t- http://www.thespecials.com \n\t\t\t- http://www.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId=3932272081 \n\t\t\t- http://www.thespecials.ultimatefanpage.com \n\t\t\t- http://www.muzu.tv/thespecials \n\n\n* * * PLEASE SEED TO A RATIO OF 1:1 OR GREATER * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢LL ONLY RE-SEED IF THERE IS MORE THAN 10 PEERS WAITING * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1201ce5b68795c8eda250bedc5bd096750d5ce3","amp;dn":"%5B1996%5D+Best+Of+-+The+Specials+-+131mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1201ce5b68795c8eda250bedc5bd096750d5ce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,32,28,229,182,135,149,200,237,162,80,190,220,91,208,150,117,13,92,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
