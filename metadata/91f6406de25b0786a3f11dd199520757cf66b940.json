However, in Rough Brunch, the aardvark states his name is indeed Aardvark. The ant has given him names as well, always beginning with &quot;Old&quot; (&quot;Old Sam,&quot; &quot;Old Ben,&quot;...etc.). In The Ant From Uncle, Charlie calls Aardvark &quot;Dad&quot; the entire episode. The Ant and the Aardvark was also the name of the first cartoon in the series. Like most DePatie-Freleng shorts, it contained a laugh track, a practice rarely used in theatrical short cartoons.\n\nThe cartoons were released by United Artists. Directors included Friz Freleng, George Gordon, Gerry Chiniquy, Hawley Pratt and Art Davis.\n\nActor and comedian John Byner (Soap) voiced both the Aardvark (as an imitation of Jackie Mason) and the Ant (imitating Dean Martin). In the episodes I&amp;#039;ve Got Ants in My Plans and Odd Ant Out, the Aardvark tussled against a rival green aardvark, similar to the way Sylvester fought other cats over Tweety in a few of Freleng&amp;#039;s earlier shorts at Warner Brothers. Because many Warner alumni worked for DFE, a lot of familiar plots were recycled in the latter studio&amp;#039;s cartoons. In Technology, Phooey, the Aardvark utilizes a computer to help think up ideas to catch the ant ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ very similar in concept to a Chuck Jones short with Wile E. Coyote. This cartoon also features yet another vocal impersonation from Byner, as the Paul Lynde-esque computer. Also, the last short ever made, From Bed to Worse, borrowed heavily from the Looney Tunes short, Greedy for Tweety.\n\n17 theatrical shorts were produced in the original series, these were subsequently featured in various television syndication packages, usually shown with DFE&amp;#039;s other characters such as the Pink Panther and the Inspector. The shorts were also reissued on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment/20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in 2007.\n\n24 years later in 1993 the characters were also featured in a later series of made-for-television shorts, produced for The Pink Panther by MGM animation.\n\nThere were many minor characters in the series. Among them was Cousin Term the Termite, the unnamed cousin ant, Aunt Minerva (Charlie&amp;#039;s Aunt), Tiny the Elephant, Tiger (voiced by Marvin Miller), the faceless scientist, the green aardvark, the unnamed nurse, the mischievous dog, the anteater-eating shark, the lifeguard who mistook Aardvark for a dog (he always said, &quot;OFF THE BEACH!&quot;), and an unnamed bear that always hurts Aardvark.\n\nenjoy. sharing is caring\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91f6406de25b0786a3f11dd199520757cf66b940","amp;dn":"Ant+and+the+Aardvark+DVDrip%2C+repost","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91f6406de25b0786a3f11dd199520757cf66b940","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,246,64,109,226,91,7,134,163,241,29,209,153,82,7,87,207,102,185,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
