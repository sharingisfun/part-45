If\nthat sounds more like an advertising slogan than a call for\nvariety, solidarity, and fun, it's not the only time the\ndisc echoes the language of a carefully planned campaign:\nthe chorus of Move Over is built around the phrase\nGeneration Next, the rallying cry of the their Pepsi\nadvert. And if, in turn, you come to the conclusion that\nthis record isn't nearly as much fun as its predecessor,\nyou're right.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thespicegirls.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thespicegirls.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n__________________________________________________\n\nncore releases &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/asianmofo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/asianmofo&lt;/a&gt; (38+) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/kijyo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/kijyo&lt;/a&gt; (1-37)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3afb054368266b06d9b26ccc4753474eee27fbe0","amp;dn":"Spice_Girls-Spiceworld-1997-ncore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3afb054368266b06d9b26ccc4753474eee27fbe0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,251,5,67,104,38,107,6,217,178,108,204,71,83,71,78,238,39,251,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
