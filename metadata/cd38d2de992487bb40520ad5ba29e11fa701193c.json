This is the iTunes version (converted to 128 kbps quality MP3) of the single track &quot;Love&quot; by Drew Micheal from the CD &quot;Comedians You Should Know&quot;. \n\nDrew Michael is a Chicago-based stand-up comedian. He's damned hilarious with dark humor, poking fun at himself and the concept of love. Check it out if you're a fan of comedians such as Louis C.K., Bill Burr, Doug Stanhope, etc. \n\nEnjoy! And don't forget to support the shared material you like in the form of legitimate purchase! =)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd38d2de992487bb40520ad5ba29e11fa701193c","amp;dn":"Drew+Michael+-+%26quot%3BLove%26quot%3B+Comedians+You+Should+Know","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd38d2de992487bb40520ad5ba29e11fa701193c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,56,210,222,153,36,135,187,64,82,10,213,186,41,225,31,167,1,25,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
