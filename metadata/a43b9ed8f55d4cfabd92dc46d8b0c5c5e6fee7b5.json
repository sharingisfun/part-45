Now it can be toldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the story which many tried to silence, many refused to believe, and many did not want to hear. In the depths of the Great Depression, the voice of a radio superhero known as The Green Ray entertained America. Forty years later, the man behind the characterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½two-bit voice actor Ray Green, known to his family as Reuven AgranovskyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is caught in an all-night blackout in the desert town of Mason, New Mexico, where a chain of events is set in motion that forces The Green Ray out of retirement. But at seventy-three, Ray faces a differentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and far more terrifyingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½world. A wildly inventive, raucously funny novel of heroism, neurosis, and transcendence, Further Adventures was ahead of its time when it was first published fifteen years ago. Like Ray Green himself, it now reemerges in a newly revised &quot;author's cut&quot; for a new generation of readers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a43b9ed8f55d4cfabd92dc46d8b0c5c5e6fee7b5","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+Further+Adventures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a43b9ed8f55d4cfabd92dc46d8b0c5c5e6fee7b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,59,158,216,245,93,76,250,189,146,220,70,216,176,197,197,230,254,231,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
