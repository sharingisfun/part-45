Is Washington in the grip of the Roman church? Soon after the presidential election of 1936, the editor of the Fellowship forum of Washington D.C., requested the author to write an article for his paper relative to the attitude which the Protestants should have toward the Roman catholic church. In complying with his request the author sent him an article which was published in the Fellowship forum for December, 1936. In response to this article, various letters were sent to him by catholic priest O'Brien, who lays plainly that they are in control of the country and intend to make it entirely catholic. Shocking revelations from the horse's mouth. 15 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b9c25af376e050f262176a56be93476bafd59ab","amp;dn":"Domenica-Washington+Under+Sway+of+Romanism%281936%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b9c25af376e050f262176a56be93476bafd59ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,156,37,175,55,110,5,15,38,33,118,165,107,233,52,118,186,253,89,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
