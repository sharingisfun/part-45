As a\nplatform for preparing and running distributed software applications, Docker is\noften compared to configuration management tools like Puppet or Ansible, or\nvirtualization tools like VirtualBox or VMware, but Docker is actually in a\ncategory of its own, offering new ways to run software applications.\n\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re familiar with deploying and managing software applications in\nproduction, this video tutorial provides the knowledge you need to Ã¢â‚¬Å“DockerizeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nan application and deploy it to the cloud using containers, images, and\nDockerfiles.\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how Docker offers powerful benefits to your organization, not only\nthrough its separation of development and operations issues, but also because\nof its efficiency compared to traditional Virtual Machines.\n\n* Learn what a typical Docker implementation includes\n* Understand the basics, including containers, images, Dockerfiles, and the Docker\n  Engine vs the Docker Hub\n* Start using Docker containers, images, and Dockerfiles\n* Dockerize a sample Python web application and deploy it to a cloud hosting service\n* Update code and its system-level dependencies once your applicationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the cloud\n* Manage multiple Docker containers at once with Fig\n* Learn tools and services from the Docker community\n* Get recommendations for how to best experiment with Docker in your organization\n* If you have experience deploying and managing software applications in production,\n  youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be ready to start using Docker with your own applications.\n\nAndrew T. Baker is an independent consultant based in Washington, DC. He is the\nauthor of spin-docker, a lightweight open-source Platform-as-a-Service powered\nby Docker and Flask.
