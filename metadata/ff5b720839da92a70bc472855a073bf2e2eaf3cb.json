It has not been changed in any way..\r\n\r\nYou will need a gateway card (or some kind of CFW) to run it on your 3DS..\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure your gateway software is updated to the newest version.. This game has new anti-piracy checks in it, so you need at least gateway launcher version 3.4.0+.. Any thing lower will cause the game to load eternally and never actually start..\r\n\r\nIt runs fine for me on this:\r\nnew-3DS\r\nsysnand: 9.2.0\r\nemunand: 9.2.0 (this game requires 9.7.0, but I think gateway spoofs the nand version maybe?)\r\ngateway launcher: 3.4.1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff5b720839da92a70bc472855a073bf2e2eaf3cb","amp;dn":"%5B3DS%5D+Fire+Emblem+if+%28Fates%29%3A+Special+Edition+%5BJPN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff5b720839da92a70bc472855a073bf2e2eaf3cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,91,114,8,57,218,146,167,11,196,114,133,90,7,59,242,226,234,243,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
