Ricks, &quot;The Gamble: General David Petraeus and the American Military Adventure in Iraq, 2006-2008&quot;\n\n\nThe Penguin Press | 2009 | ISBN: 1594201978 | 430 pages | siPDF | 8.5 MB\n\n\nFiasco, Thomas E. RicksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s #1 New York Times bestseller, transformed the political dialogue on the war in IraqÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Gamble is the next news breaking installment.\n\nThomas E. Ricks uses hundreds of hours of exclusive interviews with top officers in Iraq and extraordinary on-the-ground reportage to document the inside story of the Iraq War since late 2005 as only he can, examining the events that took place as the military was forced to reckon with itself, the surge was launched, and a very different war began.\n\nSince early 2007 a new military order has directed American strategy. Some top U.S. officials now in Iraq actually opposed the 2003 invasion, and almost all are severely critical of how the war was fought from then through 2006. At the core of the story is General David Petraeus, a military intellectual who has gathered around him an unprecedented number of officers with both combat experience and Ph.D.s. Underscoring his new and unorthodox approach, three of his key advisers are quirky foreignersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an Australian infantryman-turned-anthropologist, an antimilitary British woman who is an expert in the Middle East, and a Mennonite-educated Palestinian pacifist.\n\nThe Gamble offers news breaking information, revealing behind-the-scenes disagreements between top commanders. We learn that almost every single officer in the chain of command fought the surge. Many of PetraeusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s closest advisers went to Iraq extremely pessimistic, doubting that the surge would have any effect, and his own boss was so skeptical that he dispatched an admiral to Baghdad in the summer of 2007 to come up with a strategy to replace PetraeusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. That same boss later flew to Iraq to try to talk Petraeus out of his planned congressional testimony. The Gamble examines the congressional hearings through the eyes of Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker, and their views of the questions posed by the 2008 presidential candidates.\n\nFor Petraeus, prevailing in Iraq means extending the war. Thomas E. Ricks concludes that the war is likely to last another five to ten yearsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and that that outcome is a best case scenario. His stunning conclusion, stated in the last line of the book, is that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe events for which the Iraq war will be remembered by us and by the world have not yet happened.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAmazon.com Review\nAmazon Best of the Month, February 2009: Anyone who read Fiasco, Thomas E. Ricks's superb, bestselling account of the Iraq War through 2005, and has followed the war since has likely noticed that many of the heroes of that devastating book, the officers and analysts who seemed to understand what was going wrong in the war when the rest of the political and military leadership didn't, have since been put in charge, starting with General David Petraeus, the cerebral officer who took command in Iraq and led what became known as &quot;the surge.&quot;\n\nRicks, the senior Pentagon correspondent at the Washington Post, has stayed on the story, and he returns with his second book on the war, The Gamble: General David Petraeus and the American Adventure in Iraq, 2006-2008. As good (and influential) as Fiasco was, The Gamble may be even better, telling the remarkable story of how a few people inside and outside the Pentagon pushed the new strategy through against opposition across the political spectrum and throughout the military top brass, and then, even more remarkably, how soldiers put the difficult plan into action on the ground and managed to sharply reduce the chaotic violence in Iraq.\n\nBut the story doesn't end there, and Ricks's bracing conclusionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that the American military, like it or not, will still have a necessary role in Iraq for years to comeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½makes it likely that this may not be the last book we have from him on the subject.\n\nFrom Bookmarks Magazine\nBy and large, critics were less eager to assess Ricks's work as an author and more interested in his opinions about the success of the &quot;surge&quot; and the future of Iraq. But this is perhaps the book's greatest endorsement; whether they were liberal or conservative, American or British, critics viewed Ricks's facts as unassailable and his analysis as strong. They were impressed not just with his unparalleled access to the main actors in Iraq but also with his ability to integrate two commonly held but seemingly irreconcilable viewsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that the war was a mistake and a catastrophe (as expressed in Fiasco) and that Petraeus and the surge represented an amazing turnaround. Thus, many critics found that although Ricks seems to express a consensus view, The Gamble is counterintuitive and challenging, refreshing yet sobering.\n\nFrom Booklist\nFiasco (2006), RicksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ best-selling book about the Iraq War, dissected what went wrong. Now he explains how things began to go right.\n\nBeginning in late 2005, when the war seemed lost, he offers a compelling overview of the situation as it went forward; thanks to extensive interviews with the military principals, State Department officials, and others, there is copious detail on the rationales behind new strategies.\n\nCombining a nonfiction writerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ability to synthesize masses of facts with a storytellerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gift for narrative, Ricks shows that it was three menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½retired general Jack Keene, Lieutenant General Ray Odierno, and General David PetraeusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who, in essence, went around the chain of command to put the pieces for the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsurgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ in place. These three assume the depth and texture of fictional characters in RicksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ telling. We learn that Odierno and those under his command had the reputation of being so ham-fisted in their dealings with Iraqi civilians that they routinely turned them into insurgents. Taking OdiernoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eventual turnaround as a microcosm of what happened on the ground, Ricks carefully charts why the surge worked as well as it did.\n\nStill, his conclusions about Iraq as a whole are sobering. As the last chapter of the book details, he predicts not only that the war will go on and on but that, in fact, the most important events in the conflict have yet to occur. The Iraqis themselves, Ricks reports, are not optimistic about the future, either. As one police officer in Fallujah, who came over to the American side, puts it, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNo democracy in Iraq. Ever.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nContents\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMaps\nCast of Characters\nAcronyms and Abbreviations\nPhotos\n\nPart One: The Old War Ends [1]\n 1 Things Fall Apart (Fall 2005) [3]\n  Lost and Adrift\n  Gen.
