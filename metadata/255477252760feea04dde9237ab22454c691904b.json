John Ryder, an abrasive yet brilliant and noble starship captain, faces execution for refusing to destroy an ally starship as part of an involuntary kamikaze tactic. He has been given a chance to put his skills to use one last time, by leading a Dirty Dozen-like crew in a long-term guerrilla war against the Chasta.\n\nEllis got the idea for Switchblade Honey while watching Star Trek: Voyager, and commenting on how he preferred Patrick Stewart to Kate Mulgrew. He then had an entertaining thought:\n\n&quot;They should get Ray Winstone as captain.&quot;\n\nHe realized that modern TV science fiction tended to whitewash its characters, and using the actor as the archetype, came up with a foul-mouthed, chain-smoking, hard-drinking starship captain - John Ryder. McKinney agreed to draw the book, and the result was Switchblade Honey.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:255477252760feea04dde9237ab22454c691904b","amp;dn":"Switchblade+Honey+%28AiT%2FPlanet+Lar%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"255477252760feea04dde9237ab22454c691904b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,84,119,37,39,96,254,234,4,221,233,35,122,178,36,84,198,145,144,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
