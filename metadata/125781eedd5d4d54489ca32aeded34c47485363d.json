Sonja is seen as a curiosity in the minuscule Texas town of Dorfburg. Twenty-nine-years-old, and big-boned, she is purported to be the daughter of a famous Native American trick-roper. Her mother, Tinka, a transplanted German who despises Americans, has never understood book-crazed, dark-skinned Sonja. Now that her mother is marrying a fang-toothed linoleum salesman, Sonja may finally get the chance to move out of the stifling burg and begin a search for the father she has never known. With an unforgettable cast of characters, Bird's enjoyable novel never fails to intrigue. Cynthia Darlow's animated narration perfectly suits Bird's richly descriptive prose","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:125781eedd5d4d54489ca32aeded34c47485363d","amp;dn":"Sarah+Bird-Virgin+of+the+Rodeo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"125781eedd5d4d54489ca32aeded34c47485363d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,87,129,238,221,93,77,84,72,156,163,42,237,237,52,196,116,133,54,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
