Stuck in a dead-end job with a boss he can't stand and a materialistic girlfriend, Sam rises from a late night of barhopping to discover his whole world has changed.  Literally. \n \nAn avian flu outbreak has killed millions, the nation's infrastructure has crashed and a dirty bomb has destroyed Seattle.  Forced to go on the run, Sam awakes to a normal world the next day - and to chaos again the day after that.  A single constant between the two world will undo all the damage, if he can find it - but that seems impossible.  In one world, anything goes.  In the other, he's out of danger and sleepwalking through life.  So Sam's got an even bigger problem:  which world to choose?  \n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded] - Prophet (021-039) | (Brandon Graham):\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8959661&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8959661&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Music)] - State of Decay OST (2013) - Jesper Kyd:\n            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you have any questions please feel free to ask! **\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47f66ef89c64c67c447b9ba621871c69dba67ae6","amp;dn":"Revolver+%7C+%28Matt+Kindt%29+%28Vertigo%29+%5BGN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47f66ef89c64c67c447b9ba621871c69dba67ae6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,246,110,248,156,100,198,124,68,123,155,166,33,135,28,105,219,166,122,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
