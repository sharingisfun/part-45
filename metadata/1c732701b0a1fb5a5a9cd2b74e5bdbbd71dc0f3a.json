Perhaps too closely\nreleased on the heels of \\&quot;Tapestry\\&quot;, \\&quot;Music\\&quot; has certainly been overshadowed by that\nprevious trademark, landmark work.\n\nWith \\&quot;Music\\&quot;, King experiments with some new sounds and styles, such as the R &amp; B track\n\\&quot;Brother, Brother\\&quot; which opens the album with a sound reminiscent of the tune \\&quot;What\\'s Going\nOn?\\&quot; The title track is a truly uplifting jazz waltz with an incredible sax improvisation as a\ncenterpiece.\n\nThe simplicity and honesty of \\&quot;It\\'s Going To Take Some Time\\&quot; is stunning and certainly\nsurpasses The Carpenter\\'s more orchestrated version of the tune during the same year.\nThroughout \\&quot;Music\\&quot;, she effectively utilizes a pair of strong female backup vocalists who\nstrengthen King\\'s own delivery of her material and who bring a richness and soulfulness to\ntunes such as \\&quot;Growing Away From Me\\&quot; and the Goffin/King standard \\&quot;Some Kind of\nWonderful.\\&quot;\n\nIf this album had received as much press and airplay through the years as \\&quot;Tapestry\\&quot; did,\ntunes like \\&quot;Song of Long Ago\\&quot; (with background vocals courtesy of James Taylor) and \\&quot;Carry\nYour Load\\&quot; would now be instant classics. As it is \\&quot;Sweet Seasons\\&quot; is the only top-10 single\nfrom the album and the only one most people would be likely to recall.\nOver all, \\&quot;Music\\&quot; does not have the musical cohesiveness of her next two projects \\&quot;Rhymes &amp;\nReasons\\&quot; and \\&quot;Fantasy\\&quot;, but song for song it certainly contains some of the best material she\nhas ever recorded. Like Tapestry....a classic!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_King&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_King&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n \n  01. \\&quot;Brother, Brother\\&quot; / 3:00\n  02. \\&quot;It\\'s Going to Take Some Time\\&quot; (King, Toni Stern) / 3:35\n  03. \\&quot;Sweet Seasons\\&quot;(King, Toni Stern) / 3:15\n  04. \\&quot;Some Kind of Wonderful\\&quot; (King, Gerry Goffin) / 3:07\n  05. \\&quot;Surely\\&quot; / 4:58\n  06. \\&quot;Carry Your Load\\&quot; / 2:52\n  07. \\&quot;Music\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n  08. \\&quot;Song of Long Ago\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:44\n  09. \\&quot;Brighter\\&quot; / 2:46\n  10. \\&quot;Growing Away from Me\\&quot; / 3:03\n  11. \\&quot;Too Much Rain\\&quot; (King, Toni Stern) / 3:35\n  12. \\&quot;Back to California\\&quot; / 3:23\n\n\nPlaying Time.........: 00:40:16\nTotal Size...........: 205.26 MB\n\nPersonnel\n\nCarole King - Piano, Electric piano, Electric Celeste, Backing Vocals\nRalph Schuckett - Organ, Electric Piano, Electric Celeste\nDanny \\&quot;Kootch\\&quot; Kortchmar - Acoustic &amp; Electric guitars, Backing Vocals\nJames Taylor - Acoustic Guitar, Backing Vocals\nCharles Larkey - Electric and Acoustic bass guitar\nJoel O\\'Brien, Russ Kunkel - drums\nMs. Bobbye Hall - Congas, bongos, Tambourine\nTeresa Calderon - Congas\nCurtis Amy - Tenor Saxophone, Electric Flute\nOscar Brashear - Flugelhorn\nWilliam Green, William Collette, Ernest Watts, Plas Johnson, Mike Altschul - woodwind, Flute, &amp; Saxophone\nAbigale Haness - Backing Vocals\nMerry Clayton - Backing Vocals\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/6758/included1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/6758/included1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/366/included2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/366/included2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/1495/included3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/1495/included3.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c732701b0a1fb5a5a9cd2b74e5bdbbd71dc0f3a","amp;dn":"Carole+King+-+Music+1971+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D+%28oan%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c732701b0a1fb5a5a9cd2b74e5bdbbd71dc0f3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,115,39,1,176,161,251,90,90,156,210,183,78,91,219,189,113,220,15,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
