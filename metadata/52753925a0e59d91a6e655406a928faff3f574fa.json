Lead, Gil Bridges brags about his musical ability on the loud, horn dominated stomper &quot;Big John In My Name.&quot;A haunting arrangement of &quot;Smiling Faces Sometimes&quot; will make you shiver. And you don&amp;#039;t get much more sensual than the soft and lush &quot;Come With Me,&quot; where a female simulates an orgasm that puts Donna Summers&amp;#039; exhibition on &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; to shame; it&amp;#039;s the only new song on the LP, but who&amp;#039;s quibbling, MA is da bomb!\n\n\n\n01.
