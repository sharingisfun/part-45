Kennedy around the 50th anniversary of his â€œrendezvous with death.â€ Heâ€™s encouraging us to face what has seemed to me a central question â€” not so much the â€œWho Killed JFK?â€ bumper-sticker, but more â€œWhy canâ€™t we know?â€ The answer, Jim Douglas says, is â€œunspeakable.â€ Heâ€™s adopting a code-word that the late Trappist monk and author Thomas Merton applied to the eternal enemy, â€œthe void,â€ darkness iself, â€œsystematic evil that goes beyond the imagination.â€ Douglassâ€™s â€œunspeakableâ€ is the multifarious modern Satan which took the form of a movement in the upper reaches of Kennedyâ€™s own national security state to kill the president as he made a radical and inspired turn toward peace. He has written a conspiracy book with a scholarâ€™s footnotes and a theological subtext. And a robust Oliver Stone endorsement.\r\n\r\nDouglassâ€™s JFK and the Unspeakable is a meticulous compilation of Kennedy and assassination studies. I came to it late, five years after publication, on the recommendation of friends sharing a precious secret. Itâ€™s a shocker that has the air, throughout, of a deeply serious inquiry. Jim Douglass has his own temperate, good-humored air. Born in Canada, heâ€™s lived many years in Birmingham, Alabama as a Catholic Worker peace activist and soup-kitchen friend of the down-and-out, all the while teaching himself how to research and write history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf9840c1de41889bfc7a9168204f6d9b07cc8e4c","amp;dn":"JFK+and+The+Unspeakable+-Why+He+Died++2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf9840c1de41889bfc7a9168204f6d9b07cc8e4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,152,64,193,222,65,136,155,252,122,145,104,32,79,109,155,7,204,142,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
