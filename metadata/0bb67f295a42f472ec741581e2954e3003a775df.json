BROTHERS tells the powerful story of two siblings, thirtysomething Captain Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) and younger brother Tommy Cahill (Jake Gyllenhaal), who are polar opposites. A Marine about to embark on his fourth tour of duty, Sam is a steadfast family man married to his high school sweetheart, the aptly named Grace (Natalie Portman), with whom he has two young daughters (Bailee Madison, Taylor Grace Geare). Tommy, his charismatic younger brother, is a drifter just out of jail whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always gotten by on wit and charm. He slides easily into his role as family provocateur on his first night out of prison, at SamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s farewell dinner with their parents, Elsie (Mare Winningham) and Hank Cahill (Sam Shepard), a retired Marine.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.traileraddict.com/trailer/brothers/international-trailer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.traileraddict.com/trailer/brothers/international-trailer&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBrothers.2009.1080p.BluRay.x264-SECTOR7\n\nDate ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ 03.11.2010\nSource ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ 1080P BluRay \nVideo ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ 1920x800 @ ~9361 kbps\nAudio ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ DTS @ 1509 kbps\nIMDB ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ 7.5/10 (7,427 votes)\nIMDB LINk ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765010/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765010/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bb67f295a42f472ec741581e2954e3003a775df","amp;dn":"Brothers+2009+1080p+BluRay+x264-SECTOR7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bb67f295a42f472ec741581e2954e3003a775df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,182,127,41,90,66,244,114,236,116,21,129,226,149,78,48,3,167,117,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
