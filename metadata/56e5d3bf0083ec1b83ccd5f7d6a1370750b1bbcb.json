It is a philosophical mockumentary of North Korea, with twisted humor.\n\n52min. Narrated in English with Finnish subtitles \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.infinitehumanstupidity.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.infinitehumanstupidity.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\n&quot;Themepark 1984&quot; is a mockumentary of North Korea. It takes an evolutionary view of the sad subject, and lightens it with dark and polemic humor. It was filmed during the 60th birthday of the Democratic Republic of Korea in September 2008. The film visits Pyongyang, the radio active spa hotel, Sinchan massacre museum with the worst anti-US propaganda ever seen, a themepark, the DMZ, and the massive Arirang stadium. It also reviews the North Korean ideologies and its &quot;Great Leaders&quot;.\n\nActual propaganda films were acquired from North Korea, and some footage is included in the documentary. The film is a travel documentary, informative documentary (e.g., food crisis and collapsed economy) and a humorous critique through the eyes of a Westerner (e.g, examining the Juche ideology).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56e5d3bf0083ec1b83ccd5f7d6a1370750b1bbcb","amp;dn":"Themepark+1984+-+North+Korea+Mockumentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56e5d3bf0083ec1b83ccd5f7d6a1370750b1bbcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,229,211,191,0,131,236,27,131,204,213,247,214,161,55,7,80,177,187,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
