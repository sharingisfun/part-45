Following the massive success of the lackluster Music To Watch Girls By, it fell to The Best &quot;Kings &amp; Queens Of Cool&quot; Album In The World...Ever! to provide a truly exceptional overview of the whole &quot;easy listening&quot; vibe. 54 tracks spread across two CDs, Kings &amp; Queens Of Cool manages to avoid filler, with the likes of Dean Martin, Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, Andy Williams, Tom Jones and Nancy Sinatra all providing a number of classic tracks. Even Nancy's dad, Frank, appears with his daughter for a duet on &quot;Somethin' Stupid&quot;, although this is the only track to feature the former leader of the Rat Pack. Still, though, as a taster for the cocktail set, this compilation is one of the best you'll find.\n\nAll individually tracked, full filenames and tagged...
