Quartet (1948) was followed by Trio (1950). Encore, a co-production between Paramount and Rank, is also based on three of the writerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vignettes.\n\nFirst of the stories is The Ant and The Grasshopper [directed by Pat Jackson, scripted by T.E.B. Clarke], in which Nigel Patrick is a neÃ¢â‚¬â„¢er-do-well who soaks his lawyer brother for cash until he lands a wealthy heiress. Acting of Patrick and Roland Culver, as his brother, sets a high standard.\n\nWinter Cruise [Anthony Pelissier/Arthur Macrae] is another light piece, but of a contrasting type. Kay Walsh plays a middle-aged garrulous spinster who takes a trip by cargo boat to Jamaica, but whose non-stop chattering drives the captain and crew to distraction. Fine acting and a flawless script keeps the fun rolling in this.\n\nThe drama and tension of the series is provided by the third subject, Gigolo and Gigolette [Harold French/Eric Ambler]. This is a dramatic piece about a young vaud- eville artist whose specialty is diving from an 80-foot platform into a five-foot lake of flames. When the girl begins to feel that her husband is persisting with the act because of the money that goes with it, she loses her nerve. Glynis Johns makes a deep impression as the girl, and Terence Morgan aptly suggests the weak, scheming husband.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 700mb\nDuration.... 01:25:09\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 640\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate.... 1046kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 103kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfedc8651ef0cde5e60b54bb4f15b1359680c6d0","amp;dn":"Encore+1951+DvdRip+Avi+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfedc8651ef0cde5e60b54bb4f15b1359680c6d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,237,200,101,30,240,205,229,230,11,84,187,79,21,177,53,150,128,198,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
