The Asharite empire has splintered into decadent city-states led by warring petty kings. King Almalik of Cartada is on the ascendancy, aided always by his friend and advisor, the notorious Ammar ibn Khairan Ã¢â‚¬â€ poet, diplomat, soldier Ã¢â‚¬â€ until a summer afternoon of savage brutality changes their relationship forever.\n\nMeanwhile, in the north, the conquered Jaddites' most celebrated Ã¢â‚¬â€ and feared Ã¢â‚¬â€ military leader, Rodrigo Belmonte, driven into exile, leads his mercenary company south.\n\nIn the dangerous lands of Al-Rassan, these two men from different worlds meet and serve Ã¢â‚¬â€ for a time Ã¢â‚¬â€ the same master. Sharing their interwoven fate Ã¢â‚¬â€ and increasingly torn by her feelings Ã¢â‚¬â€ is Jehane, the accomplished court physician, whose own skills play an increasing role as Al-Rassan is swept to the brink of holy war, and beyond.\n\nHauntingly evocative of medieval Spain, The Lions of Al-Rassan is both a brilliant adventure and a deeply compelling story of love, divided loyalties, and what happens to men and women when hardening beliefs begin to remake Ã¢â‚¬â€ or destroy Ã¢â‚¬â€ a world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9788f917bf8cb6d6b4002beb4e8825f4030ea112","amp;dn":"The+Lions+of+Al-Rassan+by++Guy+Gavriel+Kay+%28Retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9788f917bf8cb6d6b4002beb4e8825f4030ea112","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,136,249,23,191,140,182,214,180,0,43,235,78,136,37,244,3,14,161,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
