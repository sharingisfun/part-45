The books were LaHaye's brainchild, though Jerry B. Jenkins, a former sportswriter with numerous other works of fiction to his name, did the actual writing of the books from LaHaye's notes.[10] LaHaye has said, &quot;I write the best I can. I know I'm never going to be revered as some classic writer. I don't claim to be C. S. Lewis. The literary-type writers, I admire them. I wish I was smart enough to write a book that's hard to read, you know?&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eab5014a370c9ea16cfab3e5b2e1e0f1c7739164","amp;dn":"Revelation+Rapture+-+Tim+LaHaye+and+Jerry+B+Jenkins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eab5014a370c9ea16cfab3e5b2e1e0f1c7739164","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,181,1,74,55,12,158,161,108,250,179,229,178,225,224,241,199,115,145,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
