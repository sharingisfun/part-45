When something is deleted Recovery Vault makes it possible to recover not only the file itself, but also its properties, such as original file name, location, etc. So you will always be able to recover data from Mac files system (HFS/HFS+) &amp; FAT32 partitions. Disk Drill also includes powerful S.M.A.R.T. disk monitoring right out-of-the-box; you can monitor your disks' hardware status and get automatic notifications of potential failures or other issues. If a disk or partition is failing, you can easily backup it into a disk image (DMG) which can later be mounted for recovery.\n\n\n\nWhat's New in Version 1.3.123:\n\n* Preferences: selection of Celsius or Fahrenheit measurement units to\n  display disk temperature in menu bar\n\n* Scanning: we implemented a totally new main recovery core, Quick\n   Scan is more accurate and produces better results now, better scanning\n  of all file systems\n\n* Speed: Deep Scan performance was improved, now it's faster by 20%\n  at least, even on huge hard drives\n\n* Reliability: Deep Scan stability was also improved, less inconsistent\n  results and better fragmentation treatment\n\n* Deep Scan: enhanced detection of ZIP files\n\n* Explanations: built-in tutorial was updated to match all the new features\n\n* Fixed: several reported crashes and exceptions\n\nVersion 1.3.123:\n\n* Preferences: selection of Celsius or Fahrenheit measurement units to\n  display disk temperature in menu bar\n\n* Scanning: we implemented a totally new main recovery core, Quic\n  Scan is more accurate and produces better results now, better scanning   \n  of all file systems .\n\n* Speed: Deep Scan performance was improved, now it's faster by 20\n  at least, even on huge hard drives more...\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements: \n\nPPC / Intel, Mac OS X 10.5 or later.\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84cf196a3cfca6c37964eefc1191434b8255d5ef","amp;dn":"Disk+Drill+v+1.3.123+with+%5BK%5Drack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84cf196a3cfca6c37964eefc1191434b8255d5ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,207,25,106,60,252,166,195,121,100,238,252,17,145,67,75,130,85,213,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
