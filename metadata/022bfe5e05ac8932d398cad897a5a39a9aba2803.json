The Maf2006 conference, held at the University of Salerno in 2006, had precisely this purpose and the collection here published gathers some of the papers presented at the conference and successively worked out to this aim. They cover a wide variety of subjects in insurance and financial fields, all treated in light of the successful cooperation between the two quantitative methods.
