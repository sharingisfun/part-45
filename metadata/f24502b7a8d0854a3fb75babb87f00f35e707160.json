The monsoon pours six metres \nof rainfall each year on the remote peaks and isolated valleys of the \nGhats. Alongside familiar Indian species like elephants, tigers and \npeacocks are more mysterious creatures that are not found anyhere else -\n a purple frog with a face like a shrew and a monkey with a lion-like \nmane and tail.\n\nMost intriguing of all, there is a chance sighting of a grey big cat, \nunlike anything scientists have seen before. To find out whether this \nenigmatic cat-in-the-ghat really is a new species, Sandesh must climb to\n the summit of these mountains. His journey is a reminder that in \nfast-track, modern India, this cloud-wrapped wilderness is more precious\n than ever.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00gslkc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00gslkc&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CakGaAaDL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CakGaAaDL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CaKggAAdL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CaKggAAdL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cakGIaAdL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/cakGIaAdL&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThanks to Sandesh for this wonderful gift. Real glory of \nWestern Ghats has been filmed very well and I feel proud to live in this\n region.\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f24502b7a8d0854a3fb75babb87f00f35e707160","amp;dn":"BBC+Natural+World+-+The+Mountains+of+the+Monsoon+HDTV+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f24502b7a8d0854a3fb75babb87f00f35e707160","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,69,2,183,168,208,133,74,63,183,91,171,184,127,0,243,94,112,113,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
