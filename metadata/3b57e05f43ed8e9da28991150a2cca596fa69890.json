Tim Hunt.\nSir Tim Hunt, awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the mechanism of how cells divide, recalls moments in his life that provided inspiration for his career as a scientist, from his father's intent scholarship which shaped his early methods to his mother's battle with cancer and the influence of this on his position at Cancer Research UK. Hunt recounts the events that informed his discovery and reveals his own opinions on the thought processes, both logical and emotional, that led to it.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00s2xv4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00s2xv4&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1404 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: HE-AAC v1\nAudio Bitrate: 96 Kbps VBR 48KHz\nAudio Streams: 2ch\nRunTime Per Part: 59 mins\nNumber Of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 630 MB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: HDTV\n\nSRT available from MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b57e05f43ed8e9da28991150a2cca596fa69890","amp;dn":"BBC+Beautiful+Minds+3of3+468p+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b57e05f43ed8e9da28991150a2cca596fa69890","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,87,224,95,67,237,142,157,162,137,145,21,10,44,202,89,111,166,152,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
