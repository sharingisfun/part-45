The fact that it was first published over 80 years ago has diminished neither its relevance nor significance in today's modern chess world. Lasker was both a wonderful fighter and a deep thinker; his book is the quintessence of the exceptionally successful experiences he had over many long years, and his thoughts about them. He teaches what he himself considers most important: general principles and methods applicable to any situation. Once you have read the &quot;Manual&quot;, you will become smarter - afterwards, this is bound to help you, both in chess and in life. Emanuel Lasker, the Second World Champion, begins at the most basic level, explaining the board, the pieces, how they move and then goes on to describe the fundamentals of chess strategy, chess tactics and even chess philosophy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fadf13778b2656b9ad3c347bbfd2f2a4d889366e","amp;dn":"Lasker%5C%27s+Manual+of+Chess-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fadf13778b2656b9ad3c347bbfd2f2a4d889366e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,223,19,119,139,38,86,185,173,60,52,123,191,210,242,164,216,137,54,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
