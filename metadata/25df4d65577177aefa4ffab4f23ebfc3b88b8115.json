For this, they hire two cunning lawyers (Naseeruddin Shah and Satish Shah), while Rohini Hattangadi is the opposition lawyer.\nThe court case drags on for years and the lawyers milk the old couple dry, while they become rich. Back home in the society, the old couple is ridiculed for fighting the landlord, but they fight on nevertheless.\nIn the end when the judge comes to check the condition of the chawl, Kapadia's men prop up the place thus convincing the judge that all is well with the chawl. Finally, Joshi gathers all his strength and pulls down the temporary supports put up by the men causing the building to collapse on himself.[2]\nThe film provides deep insight into the struggles of Indian 'middle class', which rarely gets space on the film screen.\n\nThe film won the 1984 National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare.\n\nCredits to gaurav900 and ontra for the U/L on the net\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087736/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087736/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCast:\nNaseeruddin Shah as Advocate Malkani\nBhisham Sahni as Mohan Joshi\nDina Pathak as Joshi's wife\nDeepti Naval\nMohan Gokhale\nRohini Hattangadi as Advocate\nPankaj Kapur\nAmjad Khan as Kundan Kapadia, landlord\nSatish Shah as Advocate\nSalim Ghouse as Advocate\n\nMedia Info :\nLanguage - Hindi\nVideo Size -  691 MB\nVideo Codec - Xvid\nVideo Container - AVI\nVideo Res - 640 x 480\nVideo Frame Rate - 29.970 fps @ 797 Kbps\nAudio Codec - MP3\nSample Rate - 44100 Hz @ 128 kbps\nLength - 2 Hours 1 mins\n\nPosters: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SZtli.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SZtli.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/hwBYn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/hwBYn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3ZXiZ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3ZXiZ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/C5cE6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/C5cE6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GNDwG.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GNDwG.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VTM4s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VTM4s.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XVXj6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XVXj6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5qcJ0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5qcJ0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTakes me 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 2 Hours to Upload &amp; Months to Seed\n\nTakes me 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\n\nTakes you just 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;.
