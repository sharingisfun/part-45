Pocketwatch (1992)\n\n\n\n\nWikipedia...\n\nIn the summer of 1991, Dave Grohl went into WGNS Studios and recorded four songs, playing all the instruments himself. The recording was combined with six songs from a previous Upland Studios session recorded in late 1990. Although both sessions occurred after joining Nirvana, Grohl unobtrusively acknowledged their existence. A tape of the songs, given to Simple Machines co-founder Jenny Toomey by Grohl, immediately became a candidate for the labels Tool Cassette Series.The 1990 sessions emerged as Grohl, then the drummer of Scream, requested his producer friend Barrett Jones to record songs in his home 8-track tape recorder. Upon accepting Simple Machines' request for a demo tape, Grohl decided to hide his identity under the pseudonym Late!, &quot;because IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m an idiot and I thought it would be funny to say to everybody, 'Sorry, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Late!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢&quot;.\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tSimple Machines\nCatalog:\t\tEMCD09\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Pokey The Little Puppy\n02.Petrol CB\n03.Friend Of A Friend\n04.Throwing Needles\n05.Just Another Story About Sketer Thompson\n06.Color Pictures Of A Marigold\n07.Hell's Garden\n08.Winnebago\n09.Bruce\n10.Milk\n11.Floaty (Live)\n12.This Is A Call (Live)\n13.Butterflies (Live)\n14.I'll Stick Around (Live)\n15.Big Me (Live)\n16.Wattershed (Live)\n17.For All The Cows (Live)\n18.Alone/Easy Target (Live)\n19.Exhausted (Live)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2496650bd797c35d4686760694611079cff3f560","amp;dn":"Foo+Fighters++-+Late%21+Pocketwatch+%281992%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2496650bd797c35d4686760694611079cff3f560","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,150,101,11,215,151,195,93,70,134,118,6,148,97,16,121,207,243,245,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
