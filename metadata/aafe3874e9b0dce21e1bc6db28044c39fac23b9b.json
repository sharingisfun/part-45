It is structured more like a radio play than the    \n          more &quot;traditional&quot; rock operas Townshend had recorded both with The Who (Tommy,      \n          Quadrophenia and the unreleased Lifehouse album) and as a solo artist (White City and\n          The Iron Man).                                                                       \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!                  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                 01.English boy                 [05:07]                                        \n                 02.Meher baba M3               [03:31]                                        \n                 03.Let's get pretentious       [03:36]                                        \n                 04.Meher baba M4 (signal box)  [02:23]                                        \n                 05.Early morning dreams        [03:54]                                        \n                 06.I want that thing           [03:58]                                        \n                 07.Outlive the dinosaur        [00:32]                                        \n                    (dialogue introduction)                                                    \n                 08.Outlive the dinosaur        [03:25]                                        \n                 09.Flame (demo)                [01:08]                                        \n                 10.Now and then                [04:25]                                        \n                 11.I am afraid                 [04:35]                                        \n                 12.Don't try to make me real   [02:59]                                        \n                 13.Predictable                 [00:34]                                        \n                    (dialogue introduction)                                                    \n                 14.Predictable                 [02:17]                                        \n                 15.Flame                       [02:41]                                        \n                 16.Meher baba M5 (vivaldi)     [02:36]                                        \n                 17.Fake it                     [03:29]                                        \n                 18.Now and then                [00:33]                                        \n                    (reprise dialogue introducti                                               \n                 19.Now and then (reprise)      [02:57]                                        \n                 20.Baba o'riley (demo version) [01:20]                                        \n                 21.English boy (reprise)       [07:05]                                        \n                                                       ____                                    \n                                                                                               \n                                               63:05 min                                       \n                                                90,7 MB    \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aafe3874e9b0dce21e1bc6db28044c39fac23b9b","amp;dn":"Pete_Townshend-Psychoderelict-%28Retail%29-1993-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aafe3874e9b0dce21e1bc6db28044c39fac23b9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,254,56,116,233,176,220,226,30,27,198,219,40,4,76,57,250,194,59,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
