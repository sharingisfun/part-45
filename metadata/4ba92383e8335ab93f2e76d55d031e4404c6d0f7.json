Andrew Clarke, Paul Hogan (in his first dramatic role), Tony Bonner, Jon Blake, Megan Williams, Ilona Rogers and Robert Coleby among many others.\n\n\nThe battle scenes are terrific and the muddy trenches of the Western Front look acceptably cold and horrible.\n\nSome of the acting goes a bit astray and there is sometimes a bit too much play on larrikinism and Ockerness, but overall it sits well as a quality drama with good characters.\n\nI say this only because I really rated ANZACs highly when I originally saw it on the box, but since then TV perfection in the shape of Band of Brothers has come along and blown almost everything else out of the water.\n\nThe DVD transfer for ANZACs is pretty good, considering its age, although it does suffer a little from graininess (not in itself a bad thing for a gritty period piece) and it lacks sharpness and contrast.\n\nStill, it is a good yarn and one Australians should take the time to watch.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088479/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088479/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode 5: The Yanks are comingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ &quot;Peaceful Penetration&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Monash appointed Commander of the 5 Australian DivisionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Battle of HamelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ The &quot;Jack ups&quot; Monash's Big Push (August 8, 1918)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Armistice (November 11, 1918)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Back Home. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode 5:\nFile size : 1.09 GB\nFormat : Audio Video Interleave\nPlayTime : 1h 35mn\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo \nCodec : XviD\nFamily : MPEG-4\nInfo : XviD project\nCodec settings : BVOP\nWidth : 688\nHeight : 512\nAspect ratio : 4/3\nFrame rate : 25 fps\n\nAudio \nCodec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nFamily : MPEG-1\nCodec profile : Joint stereo\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nBit rate mode : CBR\nWriting library : LAME3.97 \nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48 KHz\nResolution : 16\n\n\nExtras:\nFile size : 350 MB\nFormat : Audio Video Interleave\nPlayTime : 44mn 36s\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo \nCodec : XviD\nFamily : MPEG-4\nInfo : XviD project\nCodec settings : BVOP\nWidth : 640\nHeight : 480\nAspect ratio : 4/3\nFrame rate : 25 fps\n\nAudio \nCodec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nFamily : MPEG-1\nCodec profile : Joint stereo\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nBit rate mode : CBR\nWriting library : LAME3.97 \nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48 KHz\nResolution : 16\n\n\n\nThis is the last Episode of the miniseries.I also included the Extras that contains interviews with the actors and the showing of the making of the series.Hope you have enjoyed and can reflect what our boys achieved especially leading up to Anzac day (April 25th)for our young country at the time,and laying down the platform for our Anzac spirit.\nLest we forget.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba92383e8335ab93f2e76d55d031e4404c6d0f7","amp;dn":"ANZACs-Australian+TV+Miniseries+%281985%29+Episode+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba92383e8335ab93f2e76d55d031e4404c6d0f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,169,35,131,232,51,90,185,63,46,118,213,93,3,30,68,4,198,208,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
