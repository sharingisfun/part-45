Horn and her trio swing hard on these tracks, and the organic R&amp;B tinged jazz arrangements absolutely simmer, with Horn singing, playing piano, and Hammond B-3 organ. Her distinctive sultry and smoky vocals are bluesy and conversational, similar in approach to Charles&amp;#039;. Horn&amp;#039;s masterly chord cluster style of piano playing punctuates her every vocal phrase.\n\nPersonnel: Shirley Horn (vocals, piano, organ); Gary Bartz (alto saxophone); Charles Ables (guitar, bass); Tyler Mitchell (bass); Steve Williams (drums); The Hornettes (background vocals).\n\nRecorded at Clinton Recording Studios, New York, New York, from April-May 1993.\n\nTrack listing:\n1.Hit the Road Jack (Percy Mayfield) (3:11)\n2.Just a Little Lovin&amp;#039; (Eddy Arnold, Zeke Clements)(4:07)\n3.You Don&amp;#039;t Know Me (Eddy Arnold, Cindy Walker) (2:58)\n4.Drown in My Own Tears (Henry Glover) (5:04)\n5.Hard Hearted Hannah (Milton Ager, Bob Bigelow)(3:36)\n6.Georgia on My Mind (Hoagy Carmichael, Stuart Gorrell)(5:20)\n7.Makin&amp;#039; Whoopee (Walter Donaldson, Gus Kahn)(3:54)\n8.Green (It&amp;#039;s Not Easy Being Green) (3:16)\n9.Bye Bye Love (Felice Bryant, Boudleaux Bryant)(5:26)\n10.The Sun Died (Ray Charles)  (5:39)\n11.How Long Has This Been Going On?
