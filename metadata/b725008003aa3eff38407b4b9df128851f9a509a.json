In the hours before the State Opening, the plot is foiled, and a new date is imprinted on a nation's consciousness.\n\nOver 400 years later, the memory of Guy Fawkes still sets the country alight every Bonfire Night. Gunpowder, Treason and Plot follows the doomed conspirators to their desperate end and takes a closer look at the hotly contested mysteries behind the official version that still intrigue historians and conspiracy theorists alike.\n\nThis documentary pack includes two documentaries. One was originally show in 2001 on UK's Channel 4 and was in the style of a documentary drama. The other was a BBC Timewatch programme from 2004 which was later shown on National Geographic.\n\nBoth are tv rips.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b725008003aa3eff38407b4b9df128851f9a509a","amp;dn":"The+Gunpowder+Plot+Documentary+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b725008003aa3eff38407b4b9df128851f9a509a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,37,0,128,3,170,62,255,56,64,123,75,157,241,40,133,31,154,80,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
