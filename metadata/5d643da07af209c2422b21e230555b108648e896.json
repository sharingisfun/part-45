Called upon to rescue the beautiful and buxom daughter (Sharon Tate) of an innkeeper from a Draculalike bloodsucker, the duo muddle through all sorts of scrapes, the most intense being a scene in which a room full of dancing vampires realize the human interlopers are the only ones in the room who are reflected in a mirror. Scary and funny, the film has some unforgettable set pieces, and a terrific score.\n\n  Starring: Jack MacGowran, Roman Polanski, Sharon Tate, Alfie Bass.\n\n  Directed by: Roman Polanski.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 43min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d643da07af209c2422b21e230555b108648e896","amp;dn":"The+Fearless+Vampire+Killers+%281967%29+%28Roman+Polanski%2C+Sharon+Tate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d643da07af209c2422b21e230555b108648e896","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,100,61,160,122,242,9,194,66,43,33,226,48,85,91,16,134,72,232,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
