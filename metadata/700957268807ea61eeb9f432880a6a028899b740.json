I love the show, its the best one on TV now besides &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; and &quot;Scrubs&quot; (whose soundtrack is coming out sometime in September). This soundtrack has its high and low points. The high points are the inclusion of both &quot;I'll Be There For You&quot; TV and Album Versions, and the Hootie and the Blowfish song which is awesome! I like mellow music that will calm me down and this CD cures that. YOU EVEN GET SOME GREAT DIALOGUE FROM THE SHOW (not new dialogue seeing that this CD was released in '95) in between songs so don't skip through it trying to find it, because its hidden in between songs. Did you really think there was going to be something bad about this CD? Anyway, check it out, you might like it you might not.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:700957268807ea61eeb9f432880a6a028899b740","amp;dn":"Friends+TV+Show+Soundtrack+32vbr+F.R.I.E.N.D.S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"700957268807ea61eeb9f432880a6a028899b740","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,9,87,38,136,7,234,97,238,185,244,50,136,10,106,2,136,153,183,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
