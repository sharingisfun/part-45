When the purchase was announced, many rushed to download the reknowned utilities, because Microsoft may make them unavailable, untrustworthy or crippled. However, sets of these utilities downloaded in July have been changed since the takeover or in preparation for it. There is a new EULA.txt in each of the current zips and the code has been changed within July.\n\nThis set was downloaded from Sysinternals site one year ago. Unfortunately it is not complete, and my copies of the info pages are in disarray so I did not include them. Also these may have been improved since July 2005. But anyway, if you want definitely pre-Microsoft versions, here they are.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13c1ce88d18a956dcc0e92527576fd0fb5ca3e96","amp;dn":"Sysinternals+utilities+-+Pre-Microsoft+versions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13c1ce88d18a956dcc0e92527576fd0fb5ca3e96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,193,206,136,209,138,149,109,204,14,146,82,117,118,253,15,181,202,62,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
