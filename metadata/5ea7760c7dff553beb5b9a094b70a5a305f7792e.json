Bakhmutov (CRC, 2015).pdf\n\nISBN 9781482262728\n\nNMR Spectroscopy in Liquids and Solids provides an introduction of the general concepts behind Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and its applications, including how to perform adequate NMR experiments and interpret data collected in liquids and solids to characterize molecule systems in terms of their structure and dynamics.\n\n\nThe book is composed of ten chapters. The first three chapters consider the theoretical basis of NMR spectroscopy, the theory of NMR relaxation, and the practice of relaxation measurements. The middle chapters discuss the general aspects of molecular dynamics and their relationships to NMR, NMR spectroscopy and relaxation studies in solutions, and special issues related to NMR in solutions.\n\n\nThe remaining chapters introduce general principles and strategies involved in solid-state NMR studies, provide examples of applications of relaxation for the determination of molecular dynamics in diamagnetic solids, and discuss special issues related to solid state NMRÃ¢â‚¬â€ including NMR relaxation in paramagnetic solids.\n\n\nAll chapters are accompanied by references and recommended literature for further reading. Many practical examples of multinuclear NMR and relaxation experiments and their interpretations are also presented. The book is ideal for scientists new to NMR, students, and investigators working in the areas of chemistry, biochemistry, biology, pharmaceutical sciences, or materials science","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ea7760c7dff553beb5b9a094b70a5a305f7792e","amp;dn":"NMR+Spectroscopy+in+Liquids+and+Solids+-+Vladimir+I.+Bakhmutov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ea7760c7dff553beb5b9a094b70a5a305f7792e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,167,118,12,125,255,85,59,235,91,154,9,75,112,165,163,5,247,121,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
