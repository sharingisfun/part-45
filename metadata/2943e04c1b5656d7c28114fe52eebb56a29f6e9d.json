My second Osmond torrent this week. There is much more to come later on (both from him and all the other Osmonds). For now just his seventies stuff I had on hand to make into mp3s. Please keep buying the new stuff at the same time as enjoying listening to these oldies but goodies from the vinyl days. This is for all you Jimmy fans, especially my new friend Fire-Woman who is a huge Jimmy Osmond fan! \n\nI will be continuing to post all the older Osmond LPs in the coming days/weeks so keep an eye out for them.
