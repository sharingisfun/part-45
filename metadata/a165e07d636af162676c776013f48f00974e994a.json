Ã¢â‚¬â€Diane Dorrans Saeks, San Francisco magazine\n\nByron Kuth and Elizabeth Ranieri have split their time over the last two decades between teaching, building, and research, and have produced a broad spectrum of work, from small-scale objects and installations, to uniquely detailed residential and institutional buildings, to large urban design proposals. With materials like the translucent glass used to sequence a view from Russian Hill, the constellation of domes used to manipulate sound at an AIDS memorial, and the eight hundred pounds of synthetic felt and one thousand C-clamps used to create the Fabrications installation at SFMOMA, the firm brings subtlety and innovation to every project. Kuth/Ranieri has been largely influenced by the uniqueness of the Bay AreaÃ¢â‚¬â€its culture, exceptional beauty, and landscape. At the same time it has earned a national and international reputation for its innovative work that integrates cultural discourse with issues of design, technology, and environmental awareness. Kuth/Ranieri's greatest strength is its vision of sustainability. It is committed to the conservation of natural resources and an informed community, establishing an investment in a future that is viable, healthful, and self-renewing.\n\nKuth/Ranieri Architects presents the breadth of their work, showing both the constructed and the theoretical, in stunning photographs and thought-provoking drawings. Insightful texts by Ila Berman, Aaron Betsky, Rodolphe el-Khoury, and Mitchell Schwarzer form a centerpiece to the book and discuss issues of modernism and meaning","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a165e07d636af162676c776013f48f00974e994a","amp;dn":"Kuth+-+Ranieri+Architects+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a165e07d636af162676c776013f48f00974e994a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,101,224,125,99,106,241,98,103,108,119,96,19,244,143,0,151,78,153,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
