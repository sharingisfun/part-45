The title could be thought of as a response to Yes' Fragile. Some feel that the group achieved a more original sound in this album; it has been described as a cross between Mountain and early ZZ Top. The arrival of Blair Thornton (replacing Tim Bachman) gave the band a true second lead guitar to pair with Randy Bachman, and dual-guitar solos are prominent features on many Not Fragile tracks. It proved to be the group's most popular album. &quot;You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet&quot; and &quot;Roll On Down The Highway&quot; were hit singles. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b7e4dc4ba4bed362b8b7e7e7178ab5630d36a31","amp;dn":"BACHMAN+-+TURNER+OVERDRIVE+-+You+Ain+t+Seen+Nothing+Yet+%281974%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b7e4dc4ba4bed362b8b7e7e7178ab5630d36a31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,126,77,196,186,75,237,54,43,139,126,126,113,120,171,86,48,211,106,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
