Dating from 1959 to 1963, this mix of studio and live material is considerably more weighted toward jazz and standards by the likes of Ellington, Cole Porter, Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein, and Irving Berlin than the more eclectic albums she would later cut in the &amp;#039;60s and &amp;#039;70s for Philips and RCA. The highlights are when she steps out of the soulful supper club style into more earthier settings, as on &quot;House of the Rising Sun,&quot; &quot;Forbidden Fruit,&quot; &quot;Gin House Blues,&quot; &quot;Work Song,&quot; and her own &quot;Children Go Where I Send You&quot; (all of which she would considerably rework over the years). Includes three previously unreleased tracks in a traditional jazz style with minimal arrangements. Note: The version of &quot;(I Loves You) Porgy,&quot; her sole Top 20 entry, is not her 1959 hit single, but a live 1960 version.   ~ Richie Unterberger, All Music Guide\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:267bdac27ba53e64ef2d2b5714f1320e1974b7d9","amp;dn":"Nina+Simone+-+The+Best+of+the+Colpix+Years+-+Jazz+-+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"267bdac27ba53e64ef2d2b5714f1320e1974b7d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,123,218,194,123,165,62,100,239,45,43,87,20,241,50,14,25,116,183,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
