When her new friends explain that they are all descended from powerful witches, and they've been waiting for Cassie to join them and complete a new generation of the Secret Circle, Cassie refuses to believe them - until Adam shows her how to unlock her incredible magical powers.\n\n\nVertaling : elthijsie, Winchestergirl &amp; Chillywitch\n\n\nSeizoen 1 Aflevering 5: Slither\n\n\nTorn between her loyalties to the Circle and her family, Cassie wrestles with the secrets she must keep from her grandmother.
