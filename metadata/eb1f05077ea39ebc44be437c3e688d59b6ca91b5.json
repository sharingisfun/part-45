Bringing you more of the very obscure and obscenely RARE goodies that are in danger of silently slipping out of cyberspace.\n\nThese are the first 2 CDs from the Rory Gallagher Officially Released Bootleg called &quot;The G-Man Bootleg Series Vol. 1&quot;.   You can read more about it here -- \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_G-Man_Bootleg_Series_Vol.1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_G-Man_Bootleg_Series_Vol.1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI'm on a bit of a Rory kick and when I found out about this release I became a man on a mission.  I searched EVERYWHERE and came up goose eggs time and time again.  Of course, a new copy is only $250 (?!?) on Amazon. \n\nSo after burning through every resource I knew of, I asked GBX to search his old HD's in hopes he'd acquired it somewhere along the way.  What a lucky break!  He found it!  And I promptly went about fixing the track lists, adding proper metadata and artwork, etc.\n\nWhat you have here is my all-time favorite live Rory Gallagher boot -- which is actually comprised of chunks of three live shows.   Obviously these discs were originally sourced from Vinyl -- you will hear cracks and pops now and again, which didn't bother me in the slightest, simply added to the atmosphere and SCORCHING PERFORMANCES throughout.\n\nCALLING HARD -- Disc One\n\n&quot;Messin With The Kid&quot; - 6:30 \n&quot;Cradle Rock&quot; - 12:10\n&quot;I Wonder Who&quot; - 9:17 \n&quot;Tatoo'd Lady&quot; - 5:29\n&quot;Stompin Ground&quot; - 5:25\n&quot;Who's That Coming&quot; - 6:18\n&quot;Bullfrog Blues&quot; - 8:56 \n&quot;Do You Read Me&quot; - 6:29\n&quot;Secret Agent&quot; - 6:07\n&quot;Calling Card&quot; - 8:14\n\nCALLING HARD -- Disc Two\n\n&quot;Bought And Sold&quot; - 7:05\n&quot;Too Much Alcohol&quot; - 4:54 \n&quot;Going To My Hometown&quot; - 5:33\n&quot;Country Mile&quot; - 6:52\n&quot;Bullfrog Blues&quot; - 10:49 \n&quot;Shin Kicker&quot; - 3:11\n&quot;The Mississippi Sheiks&quot; - 7:23\n&quot;Do You Read Me&quot; - 8:31\n&quot;Brute Force And Ignorance&quot; - 5:01\n&quot;Tattoo'd Lady&quot; - 5:17\n&quot;Shadow Play&quot; - 6:29\n&quot;Cruise On Out&quot; - 6:02\n\nWell, there you have it.  My good deed for the month for the old-school dinosaur rock types like myself out there.  Enjoy and PLAY LOUD!  MORE RORY TO THE PEOPLE!\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE -- &quot;Thank you's&quot;, &quot;Right On's&quot;, etc. always appreciated in the comments.
