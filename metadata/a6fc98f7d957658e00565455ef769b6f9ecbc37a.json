Each chapter covers a key area of implementation, with clear examples and step-by-step instructions.\n\nUsing this book, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll understand why scale matters, and what considerations you need to make. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see how to switch to using Google Cloud Platform for your hosted solution, how to use KVM for your virtualization, how to use Git, Postfix, and MySQL for your version control, email, and database, and how to use Puppet for your configuration management. For enterprise-level fault tolerance youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll use Apache, and for load balancing and high availability, you'll use HAProxy and Keepalived. For trend analysis youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to use Cacti, and for notification youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll use Nagios. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn how to utilize BIND to implement DNS, how to use DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), and how to setup remote access for your infrastructure using VPN and Iptables. You will finish by looking at the various tools you will need to troubleshoot issues that may occur with your hosted infrastructure. This includes how to use CPU, network, disk and memory management tools such as top, netstat, iostat and vmstat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6fc98f7d957658e00565455ef769b6f9ecbc37a","amp;dn":"Practical+Linux+Infrastructure+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6fc98f7d957658e00565455ef769b6f9ecbc37a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,252,152,247,217,87,101,142,0,86,84,85,239,118,155,111,158,203,195,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
