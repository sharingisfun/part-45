They were formed in 1985 in Chicago, Illinois, and have never had a line-up change. They blend thrash metal, death metal, and grindcore (sometimes with nursery rhymes and folk melodies) to form their own unique style dubbed murder metal. Lyrically, they have a strong focus on serial killers, mass murderers and a touch of sick gore humour. Most lyrics are based upon true stories and are about real infamous personalities. The content of the lyrics is historically accurate, and band members actually have known and met with convicted serial killers such as John Wayne Gacy on a personal level. They also have a side project called the Macabre Minstrels that play acoustic camp fire songs. Their current label is Decomposed Records.\nMacabre's music was strongly influenced by US and UK hardcore, grindcore, and death metal acts, ranging from The AccÃƒÂ¼sed and Cryptic Slaughter to Possessed and Napalm Death. Macabre's sickening sense of humour alienated casual metal listeners. However, it helped to gain a small but strong cult status among gore metal fans.\n\nReposted from","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97fde1185eae2ac70912a7116687523df2d82cdd","amp;dn":"Macabre+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97fde1185eae2ac70912a7116687523df2d82cdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,253,225,24,94,174,42,199,9,18,167,17,102,135,82,61,242,216,44,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
