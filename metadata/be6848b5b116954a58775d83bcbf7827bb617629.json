However his military service is not over. Once a year he is called back to serve 30 days of active military duty in the Army Reserve.  He leaves his normal life behind, his family and his daily job. He slips into his olive green fatigues and picks up his M-16.\n\n&quot;The Alpha Diaries&quot; was shot over a five-year period in the life of director and reserve soldier, Yaniv Berman. Each year for 30 days, when Alpha Company got together, the camera came along to tell the unique story of the Israeli Army Reserves.\n\nAs both the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s director  and  a reserve  soldier in  the Israeli ArmyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s  Alpha Company,  Berman  had  unparalleled  access  and  ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½lmed  the  soldiers  as  they went  about  their military  service  day  and  night.  \n\nCrossing  over  to  the  Palestinian  border  the camera  captured  remarkably  every movement  of  the  soldiers  from  the  frenetic  night-time  house arrests  to  the quiet moments of  self  reÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ection and despair. \n\nCapturing  the humiliation of both  the Palestinians who  are  subject  to  the  house  arrests  as well  as  the  Israeli  soldiers who  had  to  carry them out,  this documentary  is  the unique  story of  those who every 30 days  in  the year drop  their normal lives and under the guise of the olive green uniform, perform the toughest, most unsettling tasks,  in  the  heart  of  an  urban  Palestinian  town.  \n\nThe  camera  penetrates  the  steely  barriers  of the military barracks  and gains  fresh  insight  into  the  views of  the  soldiers who  speak  frankly  and uncompromisingly  on  a  range  of  issues  including  the  occupation,  the  conÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ict  and  the  Army. \n\nA  sensitive  exploration  of  the  conÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ict  done  ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½rst  hand  from an  individual  caught  in  the  midst  of  the  action,  Berman's ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½lm  leaves  us  with  no  doubt  that  war  leaves  scars  and victims on both sides of the camp.\n\nMoive Trailer: http://www.spike.com/video/alpha-diaries-movie/2986826\n\nAnother Trailer Also at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.revver.com/video/292137/the-alpha-diaries-trailer/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.revver.com/video/292137/the-alpha-diaries-trailer/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWebsite for the film: www.alpha-diaries.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be6848b5b116954a58775d83bcbf7827bb617629","amp;dn":"The+Alpha+Diaries+-+War+Documentary.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be6848b5b116954a58775d83bcbf7827bb617629","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,104,72,181,177,22,149,74,88,119,93,131,188,191,120,39,187,97,118,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
