The Art of Falling expresses the beauty of movement, the stasis of despair, and the unlimited possibilities that come with a new beginning.\n\nGenre: General Fiction/Classics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83034eb593e0732ffb5b63634dd2b3eef2aa97d5","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Falling+by+Kathryn+Craft","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83034eb593e0732ffb5b63634dd2b3eef2aa97d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,3,78,181,147,224,115,47,251,91,99,99,77,210,179,238,242,170,151,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
