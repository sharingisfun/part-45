Not only is he an orphan with an unfortunate nose, but also he has narcolepsy, a condition that gives him terrible nightmares and makes him fall asleep at the worst possible moments. Now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sent to a new orphanage, where he encounters vicious bullies, selfish adults, strange circumstancesÃ¢â‚¬â€and a mystery that could change his life forever. Luckily, he has one important thing in his favor: HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a genius.\n \nOn his quest to solve the mystery, Nicholas finds enemies around every corner, but also friends in unexpected placesÃ¢â‚¬â€and discovers along the way that the greatest puzzle of all is himself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3367aeee896ea2e91b2db50d3516c1aaae2383ba","amp;dn":"The+Extraordinary+Education+of+Nicholas+Benedict","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3367aeee896ea2e91b2db50d3516c1aaae2383ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,103,174,238,137,110,162,233,27,45,181,13,53,22,193,170,174,35,131,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
