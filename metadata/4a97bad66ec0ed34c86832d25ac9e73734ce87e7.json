Unlike many of the controversial and sometimes caustic works in this area, this book conclusively pinpoints the present battleground and spiritual combatants of the 21st century.\n\nAs a result of his ?success? in the Garden of Eden, Satan has unrelentingly posed his familiar ?Hath God said? question to every generation. Unfortunately, his query has frequently accomplished its designed purpose, undermining one?s faith in God?s word and causing division between the Creator and His creation.\n\nOne Book Stands Alone identifies the counterfeit authorities guilty of giving an uncertain sound. The reader will quickly discover how to recognize Satan?s multi-pronged attack aimed at:\n-the deity of Jesus Christ\n-scriptural purity and preservation\n-salvation by grace without works\n-the supremacy of preaching\n-Christ?s sinless perfection\n-the teaching of moral absolutes\n-the total elimination of certain key verses and doctrines\n\nThe main objective of this work was clearly recognized by Dr. Lee Roberson when he stated, ?One Book Stands Alone is a spiritual masterpiece. It will strengthen your faith!? In these perilous times, most men are ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. I trust that the Lord will use this book to strengthen your faith and help you withstand the onslaught of modern ?scholarship.?\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Douglas D.
