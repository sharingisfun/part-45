It was released on 19 November 2012 via Syco Music. The group began work recording the album in December 2011 and concluded in September 2012. Throughout the recording process, Little Mix worked with several producers, including TMS, Future Cut, Steve Mac, Jarrad Rogers, Richard &quot;Biff&quot; Stannard, Ash Howes, Jon Levine, Xenomania, Fred Ball and Pegasus. The album was co-written by Little Mix and they stated that they were involved in the development of the album as much as possible. Sonically, the album is primarily a mixture of pop and R&amp;B records, with influences from dance-pop, pop rock and Latin pop found on specific songs as well. The album's lyrical content explores empowerment, relationships and heartbreak. Songs on the album were also co-written by members of other girl groups, including Nicola Roberts of Girls Aloud, Shaznay Lewis of All Saints and T-Boz of TLC. DNA received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who complimented Little Mix. The album's lead single, &quot;Wings&quot;, was released on 26 August 2012, reaching number one in UK and Ireland as well as charting in Australia, New Zealand, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Belgium, Canada and the US. The second single, &quot;DNA&quot;, was released on 11 November 2012, peaking at number three in the UK. Two post-album singles were released: &quot;Change Your Life&quot; was released as the third single on 3 February 2013, while a remix of &quot;How Ya Doin'?&quot; featuring American rapper Missy Elliott was released as the fourth and final single on 17 April 2013; both songs reached the top 20 in the UK. The album has subsequently placed in the top 5 in eight countries, most notably the US where it peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100, making Little Mix the first girl group since The Pussycat Dolls in 2006 to reach the top 5 with their debut album, as well as earning the highest Billboard entry chart position for a debut album by a British girl group, breaking the record previously held by the Spice Girls' debut album Spice (1997).\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Wing\n[02] DNA\n[03] Change Your Life\n[04] Always Be Together\n[05] Stereo Soldier\n[06] Pretend It's OK\n[07] Turn Your Face\n[08] We Are Who We Are\n[09] How Ya Doin'?\n[10] Red Planet - - - Little Mix Featuring T-Boz\n[11] Going Nowhere\n[12] Madhouse\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:43m:51s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 324mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
