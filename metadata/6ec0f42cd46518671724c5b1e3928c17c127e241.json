There would be no modern mathematics or physics without algebra; no computers without algorithms; no chemistry without alkalis. From the great mathematician Al-Khwarizmi to Ibn Sina, whose Canon of Medicine was still in use as recently as the 19th century, Bagdad-born physicist Jameel Al-Khalili pieces together a remarkable story of the often overlooked achievements of the early medieval Islamic scientists.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 58mn 36s 883ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English UK\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 975 Kbps\nAspect            : 512 x 384 (1.333) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 121 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ec0f42cd46518671724c5b1e3928c17c127e241","amp;dn":"BBC-Science+and+Islam+%282009%29+1of3.PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ec0f42cd46518671724c5b1e3928c17c127e241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,192,244,44,212,101,24,103,23,36,197,177,227,146,140,23,193,39,226,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
