Can she be labeled as a jazz guitarist, though? Do such\ncategorizations hold any appeal for her at all? I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think so. Nor do I\nbelieve it is worthwhile to try and classify her artistic achievements, as\nclassifications are hardly valid in her case. Efforts of this kind are\ninterrupted by Halvorson herself who haltingly remarks: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enjoy jazz\nguitar in general.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ If anything, her music resembles indie rock; rock, we\nshould say, was her first musical experience Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the years she spent performing\nwith such bands as Xiu Xiu and People, or her fascination with the art of Jimmy\nHendrix. If we insist on working jazz into her musical activity, then jazz is\nfound in her comprehensive view of a creative process in which both the\nimprovised and the composed form a new picture; a picture being the fruit of\nperpetual searching, of constant experimenting, of incessant questioning. One\nof the key vehicles to this end is a trio Mary Halvorson set up several years\nago with John HebÃƒÂ©rt on double-bass and Ches Smith on drums. This group may\neven be the best definition of what Mary Halvorson finds essential in music\ntoday. On the one hand, it provides the ground work for complex compositional\nand improvised structures; on the other hand, it is an ideally formed organism,\nallowing her imagination to roam down the most astounding paths, liberated from\nthe ruts of style.\n\n--\n\nBy Paul Acquaro &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2013/12/roundup-more-guitars.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2013/12/roundup-more-guitars.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPoint Culture (fr) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pointculture.be/album/UH0648/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pointculture.be/album/UH0648/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53e6d61726bede3270a3cddac9f5334b1b0ff961","amp;dn":"Mary+Halvorson+Trio+-+Ghost+Loop+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53e6d61726bede3270a3cddac9f5334b1b0ff961","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,230,214,23,38,190,222,50,112,163,205,218,201,245,51,75,27,15,249,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
