An efficient gang enters a Manhattan bank, locks the doors, and takes hostages. They work deliberately, without haste. A snarky detective facing corruption charges is assigned to negotiate. The bank&amp;#039;s president has something to protect in a safe deposit box, so he brings in a high-powered fixer. With an army of police surrounding the bank, the thief, the cop, and the plutocrat&amp;#039;s fixer enter high-stakes negotiations. Why are the robbers asking for a plane - they know they won&amp;#039;t get one. Why aren&amp;#039;t they in more of a hurry? If the job&amp;#039;s perfect, why is the thieves&amp;#039; leader in a cell?&quot;\n\n----\n\nRemember to seed motha fuckas!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cf441773df35d0765bda6196746d3ff0f24bd80","amp;dn":"Inside+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cf441773df35d0765bda6196746d3ff0f24bd80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,244,65,119,61,243,93,7,101,189,166,25,103,70,211,255,15,36,189,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
