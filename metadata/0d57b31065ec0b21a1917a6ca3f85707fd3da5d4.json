Sue Perkins explores a dramatically different version, as lived and recorded by Anne Lister.

Regency England was surprisingly tolerant of Anne's chosen lifestyle, and it was only when Anne sought to sink a coal mine on her land that criticism of her private life became public.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d57b31065ec0b21a1917a6ca3f85707fd3da5d4","amp;dn":"Revealing+Anne+Lister+++%28BBC+2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d57b31065ec0b21a1917a6ca3f85707fd3da5d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,87,179,16,101,236,11,33,161,145,122,108,163,248,87,7,253,61,165,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
