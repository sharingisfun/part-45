John Waite missed a shot and Jonathan Cain made a comment on how bad his &quot;english&quot; was (referring to the spin a player puts on the cue ball) and the band decided to use the phrase.[1] The name is also thought to be a reference to The Babys, since the name was misspelled and an example of bad English.\n\n\n\n\n\nBad English 1989\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Best of What I Got&quot; (John Waite, Jonathan Cain, Neal Schon)\n2.\t&quot;Heaven is a 4 Letter Word&quot; (Schon, Cain, Waite, Mark Spiro)\n3.\t&quot;Possession&quot; (Waite, Cain, Ricky Phillips)\n4.\t&quot;Forget Me Not&quot; (Waite, Cain, Spiro)\n5.\t&quot;When I See You Smile&quot; (Diane Warren)\n6.\t&quot;Tough Times Don't Last&quot; (Cain, David Roberts, Waite)\n7.\t&quot;Ghost in Your Heart&quot; (Waite, Martin Page, Cain)\n8.\t&quot;Price of Love&quot; (Waite, Cain)\n9.\t&quot;Ready When You Are&quot; (Cain, Waite, Schon, Todd Cerney)\n10.\t&quot;Lay Down&quot; (Waite, Schon, Cain)\n11.\t&quot;The Restless Ones&quot; (Waite, Cain, Phillips)\n12.\t&quot;Rockin' Horse&quot; (Schon, Waite, Cain)\n13.\t&quot;Don't Walk Away&quot; (Andy Hill, Peter Sinfield)\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff10d1b45940bd5328784119ad8d5dc6d6853cd7","amp;dn":"Bad+English+-+Self+Titled+1989+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff10d1b45940bd5328784119ad8d5dc6d6853cd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,16,209,180,89,64,189,83,40,120,65,25,173,141,93,198,214,133,60,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
