Because their depression is goneÃ¢â‚¬â€but so are their memories.\n\nUnder constant surveillance at home and at school, Sloane puts on a brave face and keeps her feelings buried as deep as she can. The only person Sloane can be herself with is James. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s promised to keep them both safe and out of treatment, and Sloane knows their love is strong enough to withstand anything. But despite the promises they made to each other, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s getting harder to hide the truth. They are both growing weaker. Depression is setting in. And The Program is coming for them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1831474478118cdf5b38d1d4c078cd65297e2a7b","amp;dn":"The+Program+-+Suzanne+Young.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1831474478118cdf5b38d1d4c078cd65297e2a7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,49,71,68,120,17,140,223,91,56,209,212,192,120,205,101,41,126,42,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
