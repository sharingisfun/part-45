What if you want to more fundamentally change an underlying element originally captured inside the impulse response? \n\nREmatrix is the answer \nREmatrix combines five convolvers working simultaneously and in parallel without any phase issue. You can build your own IR by summing five separate IRs, offering an all new level of customizability inside the reverb. Each of the five IRs can be adjusted using multiple parameters while additional filters offer further tonal control. Furthermore, REmatrix has six Master Effects to refine the reverb's sound and fit the needs of your final mix. \n\nREmatrix combines the best of convolution reverbs along with unprecedented levels of flexibility. \n\nWhether you use the high quality factory library (based on the well-known MoReVoX libraries) or your own custom libraries, REmatrix lets you approach reverb with a brand new perspective and create both unique and unparalleled textures.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nN0TES:\nAll homecalls are NOPd out, but this doesn't mean I'm telling you to use warez while being online.\n\nYou know what I mean.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEnjoy what you have and stop crying for more on the forums like a rabid dog, go make some noise instead.\n\nWhen time will come, everything will see the light.\n\nDo the right thing and support good devs!\nC0PYL3FT3R a.k.a. 23K! - 2014\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1337x.to - demonoid.ph - fenopy.se - flashtorrents.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (08).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7b57a3439e6bd2c5f496dbff2f04a14144f83dc","amp;dn":"Overloud+-+REmatrix+v.1.0.0+OS+X+%5BC0PYL3FT3R%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7b57a3439e6bd2c5f496dbff2f04a14144f83dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,181,122,52,57,230,189,44,95,73,109,191,242,240,74,20,20,79,131,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
