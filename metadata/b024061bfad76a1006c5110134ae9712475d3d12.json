Scarred by an Indian ambush, Jubal Bragg led a vicious frontier militia, and knew, when he saw the wild, bare-chested Panther Burn ride into Castle Rock, that killing was at hand.\n\nA lie, an act of violence, and then a senseless slaughter turn Panther Burn into a renegade and Bragg into a murderer. Now, between two men and two cultures, the last epic struggle of the frontier has begun. And when it is over, a generation later, a story of courage, passion, love and tragedy will haunt the Western wind forever.\n\nSacred is the Wind\n\n...is Kerry Newcomb's masterful saga based on real events from 1865 to 1895-the story of lives lived and lost at a bloody turning point in the history of a land.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b024061bfad76a1006c5110134ae9712475d3d12","amp;dn":"Kerry+Newcomb+-+Sacred+is+the+Wind+%28retail%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b024061bfad76a1006c5110134ae9712475d3d12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,36,6,27,250,215,106,16,6,197,17,1,52,174,151,18,71,93,61,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
