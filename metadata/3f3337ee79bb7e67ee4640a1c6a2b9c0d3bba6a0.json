Author Cane, it seems, has a knack for description that really brings his evil creepy-crawlies to life. Insurance investigator John Trent is sent to investigate Cane's mysterious vanishing act and ends up in the sleepy little East Coast town of Hobb's End. The fact that this town exists as a figment of Cane's twisted imagination is only the beginning of Trent's problems....\n\nJohn Carpenter film.\n\nFor more details, click imdb link or go: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0113409/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0113409/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nStereo, 5.1, directors commentary audio tracks\nenglish subtitles available\n\nIMDB rates it at 6.7 out of 10.  I rate it higher [8 of 10] because it has freaky mental elements like Philip K Dick books, or the movies Existenz, Donnie Darko, Fight Club, and The Matrix.\n\nSam Neal gives a truly exceptional performance in this film.\n\nIf you like Lovecraft, the macabre, and dramatic horror, this should be right up your alley.  While not specifically lovecraftian, it has a flavor very similar.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f3337ee79bb7e67ee4640a1c6a2b9c0d3bba6a0","amp;dn":"In+The+Mouth+of+Madness+%5BJohn+Carpenter%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f3337ee79bb7e67ee4640a1c6a2b9c0d3bba6a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,51,55,238,121,187,126,103,238,70,64,161,198,162,185,192,211,187,166,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
