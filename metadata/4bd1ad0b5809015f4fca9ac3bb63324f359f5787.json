Using a conversational yet professional tone, Rehm provides an overview of a variety of methods in protein biochemistry/proteomics. He provides short and precise summaries of routine procedures as well as listings of the advantages and disadvantages of alternative methods. Readers will immediately sense that the author if very familiar with the challenges, and frustration of the daily lab routine. Never before has such an honest, tactical guide been available for those conducting lab experiments within the field of biochemistry.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Shows how to avoid experimental dead ends and helps users develop an instinct for the right experiment at the right time \r\nâ€¢ Contains short and precise summaries of routine procedures (e.g. column chromatography, gel electrophoresis), and lists the advantages and disadvantages of alternative methods \r\nâ€¢ Includes over 100 detailed figures and tables\r\nâ€¢ Contains a chapter on proteomics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bd1ad0b5809015f4fca9ac3bb63324f359f5787","amp;dn":"Protein+Biochemistry+and+Proteomics+-+Hubert+Rehm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bd1ad0b5809015f4fca9ac3bb63324f359f5787","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,209,173,11,88,9,1,95,79,202,154,195,187,99,50,79,53,159,87,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
