Because of this, some film critics have drawn comparisons to the popular Thai film Ong-Bak.[3][4][5] David Belle, regarded as the founder of parkour, plays LeÃƒÂ¯to, one of the protagonists in the film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8da2a741c625a25c578882b0d4136265d8add111","amp;dn":"13%26ordm%3B.Distrito.2004.dvd-r.JabaMSJP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8da2a741c625a25c578882b0d4136265d8add111","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,162,167,65,198,37,162,92,87,136,130,176,212,19,98,101,216,173,209,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
