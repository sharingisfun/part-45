In this riveting story, rich with family ties and intrigue, award-winning Boston Globe reporters Kevin Cullen and Shelley Murphy follow WhiteyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extraordinary criminal careerÃ¢â‚¬â€from teenage thievery to bank robberies to the building of his underworld empire and a string of brutal murders.\n\nIt was after a nine-year stint in Alcatraz and other prisons that Whitey reunited with his brother William &quot;Billy&quot; Bulger, who was soon to become one of MassachusettsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful politicians. He also became reacquainted with John Connolly, who had grown up around the corner from the Bulgers and was nowÃ¢â‚¬â€with BillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s helpÃ¢â‚¬â€a rising star at the FBI.\n\nOnce Whitey emerged triumphant from the bloody Boston gang wars, Connolly recruited him as an informant against the Mafia. Their clandestine relationship made Whitey untouchable; the FBI overlooked gambling, drugs, and even homicide to protect their source. Among the close-knit Irish community in South Boston, nothing was more important than honor and loyalty, and nothing was worse than being a rat. Whitey is charged with the deaths of nineteen people killed over turf, for business, and even for being informants; yet to this day he denies he ever gave up his friends or landed anyone in jail.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8be9d68041aa46cba4095e0fb3d724a9ae5ece3e","amp;dn":"Whitey+Bulger%3A+America%27s+Most+Wanted+Gangster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8be9d68041aa46cba4095e0fb3d724a9ae5ece3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,233,214,128,65,170,70,203,164,9,94,15,179,215,36,169,174,94,206,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
