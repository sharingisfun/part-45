While Ken Barnes of USA Today conceded that Chris Daughtry has &quot;strong pipes and palpable angst&quot;, overall he found the band &quot;generic&quot;, calling them &quot;FuelNickelStaindback&quot;.b[ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âº][2] People magazine found the album &quot;a solid if not spectacular effort that at the very least proves that [Chris Daughtry] is not just another Idol also-ran.&quot;[3] Christian Hoard (with Rolling Stone) said that &quot;[Chris] Daughtry gets points for not courting soccer moms, but just because he can howl like a mother fucker doesn't mean he's not a cheeseball.&quot;[4] In a truly mixed review, Billboard said the album &quot;is music tailor-made for ill-conceived radio formatting, music for consumers whose taste has already been well-established if not preprogrammed,&quot; then added, &quot;But [Chris] Daughtry sure does sing his butt off.&quot;[5] Allmusic broke from the pack, so to speak, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine calling the album a &quot;a debut that's not only a lot more credible than any American Idol-affiliated rock album should be, but it's a lot easier to digest than most of its [post-grunge] ilk.&quot;[6] In a humorous review, comedian Stephen Colbert found Chris Daughtry's success further proof of the impending &quot;cultural Armageddon.&quot; He remarked, &quot;It's bad enough this guy sounds like Creed...but Daughtry's success sets a dangerous precedent of rewarding losers...America elected Taylor Hicks as its Idol, and we owe him our loyalty.&quot;[7]\n\nThe album won an American Music Awards in 2007 or Favorite Pop-Rock Album. The album was nominated for four 2008 Grammy Awards: Best Rock Album, Best Rock Song for &quot;It's Not Over&quot;, Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for &quot;Home&quot;, and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for &quot;It's Not Over&quot;; the album did not win any.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fab9eb29a2e411259de054483de0895151cb7a32","amp;dn":"Leave+This+Town+-+Daughtry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fab9eb29a2e411259de054483de0895151cb7a32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,185,235,41,162,228,17,37,157,224,84,72,61,224,137,81,81,203,122,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
