It was released both as a single album and as a double album on LP and CD (known as AC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector's Edition). The album is supported by a video, AC/DC: Live at Donington.\n\nAC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector's Edition was released a month after the single-disc version, in a slipcased two-disc &quot;book&quot; (similar in shape to old CD longboxes) and containing an AC/DC dollar note.\n\nThe recordings on this live album are taken from several shows from AC/DC's 1991 The Razors Edge tour. The recordings are taken from Dublin, Auburn Hills (Detroit), Glasgow, Edmonton, Paris, Germany, and the Donington and Moscow &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot; shows.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t \t\n1. \t&quot;Thunderstruck&quot;   \t\t          6:34\n2. \t&quot;Shoot to Thrill&quot;   \t  \t          5:21\n3. \t&quot;Back in Black&quot;   \t  \t          4:28\n4. \t&quot;Who Made Who&quot;   \t  \t          5:15\n5. \t&quot;Heatseeker&quot;   \t  \t                  3:37\n6. \t&quot;The Jack (from Moscow 28 Sept 91)&quot;   \t  6:56\n7. \t&quot;Moneytalks&quot; (Not on vinyl) \t\t  4:18\n8. \t&quot;Hells Bells&quot;   \t  \t          6:01\n9. \t&quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot;             5:02\n10. \t&quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot;   \t \t          4:30\n11. \t&quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;   \t  3:54\n12. \t&quot;Highway to Hell&quot;   \t\t          3:58\n13. \t&quot;T.N.T.&quot;   \t\t                  3:47\n14. \t&quot;For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)&quot; 7:09\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28ada17a6cb79ab63527a7401a214656f7e9107a","amp;dn":"AcDc+-+1992+-+Live+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28ada17a6cb79ab63527a7401a214656f7e9107a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,173,161,122,108,183,154,182,53,39,167,64,26,33,70,86,247,233,16,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
