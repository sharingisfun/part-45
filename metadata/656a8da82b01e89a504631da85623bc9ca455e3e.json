Dr Johnson stated that when two Englishman meet the talk turns to the weather, Chaucer refers to the weather at the very start of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Canterbury TalesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and we Brits always turn to the weather in those awkward social situations.\n\nNothing to do with the late comic duo Morecambe &amp; Wise, whose theme song this was, Charlie Connelly takes a look at 5 aspects of the weather, by way of Austrian eccentrics, why clouds are called as they are, Benjamin Frankli, the man who was struck by lightning seven times, and the sad story of the founder of the UK Met Office. Read by Stephen Mangan, this makes for a diverting 60 minutes of listening.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:656a8da82b01e89a504631da85623bc9ca455e3e","amp;dn":"Bring+Me+Sunshine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"656a8da82b01e89a504631da85623bc9ca455e3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,106,141,168,43,1,232,154,80,70,49,218,133,98,59,201,202,69,94,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
