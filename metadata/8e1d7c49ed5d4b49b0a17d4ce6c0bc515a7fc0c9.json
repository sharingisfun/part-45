Being refreshing, entertaining as well as inspiringly confusing, it is essential reading for anyone writing on art who does not only think of what to write, but also how to write it.&quot; Contemporary\n\n&quot;Though it seems contradictory to write words of praise for a book that deeply interrogates the marketability of praiseful language (in the guise of art criticism), Gavin ButtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s collection deserves them. Framed by ButtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s astute introduction, these performative essays pulse with vitality. Food for thought, this book makes us think, again, about art and its interpretations in a new way. Critical writing as a kind of performance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ delicious.&quot; Amelia Jones, University of Manchester \n\n\n\n&quot;This anthology is an excellent overview of performative critical discourse edited and introduced by one of its leading proponents. All the contributions have an experimental or improvisational edge that preserves a sense of the critical encounter. The book is at the cutting edge of art theory and will be read with enthusiasm by a large number of people engaged with contemporary art practice and criticism.&quot; Margaret Iversen, University of Essex\n\nProduct Description\nIt has recently become apparent that criticism has fallen on hard times. Either commodification is deemed to have killed it off, or it has become institutionally routine. This book explores contemporary approaches which have sought to renew criticismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s energies in the wake of a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²theatrical turnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â² in recent visual arts practice, and the emergence of a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²performativeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â² arts writing over the past decade or so. \nIssues addressed include the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²performingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â² of artÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s histories; the consequences for criticism of embracing boredom, distraction and other ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²queerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â² forms of (in)attention; and the importance of exploring writerly process in responding to aesthetic experience. Bringing together newly commissioned work from the fields of art history, performance studies, and visual culture with the writings of contemporary artists, After Criticism provides a set of experimental essays which demonstrate how ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²the criticalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â² might live on as a vital and efficacious force within contemporary culture.\n\n\n\n*************************************************\n\nIf anyone has an alternative (non-BitTorrent) pdf database then please also make this e-book available there. \n\n*************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e1d7c49ed5d4b49b0a17d4ce6c0bc515a7fc0c9","amp;dn":"After+Criticism-New+Responses+in+Art+and+performance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e1d7c49ed5d4b49b0a17d4ce6c0bc515a7fc0c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,29,124,73,237,93,75,73,176,161,125,76,230,192,188,81,90,127,192,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
