New users are recommended to try 702, existing users do not need to upgrade unless they have problems that have been addressed in this thread prior to 702 release. The &quot;fatdog-update&quot; packages will continue to be refreshed and should be applicable to both 700, 701 and 702 for foreseeable future. \r\n\r\n Note: Fatdog64 702 features the same kernel as 700 (3.18.7). This is a conscious decision to ensure that all existing 3rd party kernel modules for 700 will continue to work in 701. \r\n\r\n If you want a newer kernel, a 4.3.3 kernel is available \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore info at:\r\n \nhttp://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=102737","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4018eac8f23702c3a8457b2a9e26d81bd7042e57","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_Fatdog64-702rc-21-Jan-2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4018eac8f23702c3a8457b2a9e26d81bd7042e57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,24,234,200,242,55,2,195,168,69,123,42,158,38,216,27,215,4,46,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
