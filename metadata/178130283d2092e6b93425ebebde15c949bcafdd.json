I used DVD Audio Extractor to rip the audio (which was 6 channel 24/48 MLP) to 6 channel 24/48 flac.\n\nI re-mixed the DualDisc DVD-A 5.1 audio to stereo in audacity, bringing back all of the lost dynamics in both the CD and Stereo mix on the DVD-A.  Please note that the front two tracks were almost always brickwalled, so I decreased the bass in those tracks to bring back some dynamics in them, and then upped the bass track a little to compensate for the less bass.\n\nI think it sounds a lot better than the CD, and you can hear a lot more details in the music than you could before (on average it is 6db lower than the CD). On top of that, it's in 24/48 (flac), so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty much perfect audio. If you really want 96khz sampling rate, use the SoX resampler in foobar.\n\nI did edit some songs from the originals during the re-mixing, as some sounds are in center channel and are only on mono, and didn't give much stereo separation. Because of this, I took the mono track, doubled it, inverted one, and made it a stereo track. An example of this is during the bridge (not through the entire song) of &quot;The Hands the Feeds&quot;.\n\nYou can find the &quot;Dynamic Range Meter&quot; results here:\n\nHere are visual comparisons of the waveforms: \n\nCD Version: https://i.imgur.com/78Khrah.png\n\nDVD Remaster: https://i.imgur.com/C8nzMSM.png\n\nPlease seed if you enjoy this torrent, and please leave feedback","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:178130283d2092e6b93425ebebde15c949bcafdd","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+With+Teeth+%5BRemaster%5D+%28DVD-A+Stereo%29+24%2F48+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"178130283d2092e6b93425ebebde15c949bcafdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,129,48,40,61,32,146,230,185,52,37,235,235,222,21,201,73,188,175,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
