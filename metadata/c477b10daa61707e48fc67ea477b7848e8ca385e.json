All profits are to benefit PAWS (Philadelphia Animal Wellness Society), the\n only no-kill shelter in Philadelphia. Curated by Dean Troxell and Joe Scott, the dark music\n experts from Philadelphia's Digital Ferret Music Store, the compilation is a showcase of\n some of the most exciting artists in post punk, minimal wave, experimental, rhythmic noise\n and death rock. The 36 tracks spanning the two discs bring exclusive tracks from established\n genre leaders like darkwave icons Black Tape for A Blue Girl to artists who make their cd\n debut such as the experimental Blood Rhythm. Ambitious in its selection and scope but\n unified in theme and vitality, More Than Nine Lives is a glimpse at what is at the forefront\n of the dark music genres in 2011. Whether you enjoy this compilation for the music or the\n cause, remember it's limited to 500 copies and has undeniably endearing cover artwork from\n Mike Wohlberg\n \nX A B O U T X\n \nDo you like this release ?
