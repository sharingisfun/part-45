It is argued here that these differences can be accounted for by planetoid capture processes and the subsequent evolution of the planet-satellite system. Venus captured a one-half moon-mass planetoid early in its history in the retrograde direction and underwent its â€œfatal attraction scenarioâ€ with its satellite (Adonis). Earth, on the other hand, captured a moon-mass planetoid (Luna) early in its history in prograde orbit and underwent a benign estrangement scenario with its captured satellite","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4f98849fff27eb0b7024064fb53acb53529cd89","amp;dn":"The+Twin+Sister+Planets+Venus+and+Earth+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4f98849fff27eb0b7024064fb53acb53529cd89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,249,136,73,255,242,126,176,183,2,64,100,251,83,172,181,53,41,205,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
