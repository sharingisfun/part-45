The story tells the adventures of the wandering sailor Ishmael and his voyage on the whaleship Pequod, commanded by Captain Ahab. Ishmael soon learns that Ahab seeks one specific whale, Moby-Dick, a white whale of tremendous size and ferocity. Comparatively few whaleships know of Moby-Dick, and fewer yet have encountered him. In a previous encounter, the whale destroyed AhabÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s boat and bit off his leg. Ahab intends to take revenge.\n\nIn Moby-Dick, Melville employs stylized language, symbolism, and metaphor to explore numerous complex themes. Through the main characterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s journey, the concepts of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of gods are all examined as Ishmael speculates upon his personal beliefs and his place in the universe. The narratorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reflections, along with his descriptions of a sailorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life aboard a whaling ship, are woven into the narrative along with Shakespearean literary devices such as stage directions, extended soliloquies and asides.\n\n\nwww.opencast.de we provide free ebooks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:037b486f430eca3e1101fe37c87e9749d87e0053","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+Moby+Dick+by+Herman+Melville+%5Bwww.opencast.de%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"037b486f430eca3e1101fe37c87e9749d87e0053","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,123,72,111,67,14,202,62,17,1,254,55,200,126,151,73,216,126,0,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
