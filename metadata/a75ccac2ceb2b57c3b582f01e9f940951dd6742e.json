I usually describe them as similar to the Go-Go's with more clever lyrics.  Fronted by two sisters, Tracey Bryn and Missy Belland, with Tracey doing the bulk of the songwriting.  Lots of fun songs from a fantastic band who just never got the breaks to hit it really big.  I also included an 55-minute interview from 2008 I found on Revenge of the 80s Radio that includes several songs.  Also, their website appears to have died, so I included a long .txt file I had copied-and-pasted detailing their history.\n\n\n*********************************************\n\nStupid Boy        \nCupid (I'm Shooting Cupid Demo)        \nDoriah        \nShine Away        \nPlaying House (Demo)        \nModern Heart        \nOnly If You Want To (Demo)        \nHeavenly (Demo)        \nBaby Don't Stay        \nWaitress    \nPocket Sized        \nPerfect Place (Demo) \n\n\nFrom Discogs dot com:  The band made this CD of demos available from their website in 2003.  Two of the 12 tracks were previously released in the same form as B-sides (Shine Away &amp; Pocket Sized). The rest were previously unheard demo takes or new demos.\n\n\n\nin .wma in a variable bit rate\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a75ccac2ceb2b57c3b582f01e9f940951dd6742e","amp;dn":"Voice+of+the+Beehive+-+Bee-Sides%2C+interview%2C+history","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a75ccac2ceb2b57c3b582f01e9f940951dd6742e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,92,202,194,206,178,181,124,59,88,47,1,233,249,64,149,29,214,116,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
