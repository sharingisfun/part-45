After a year of dating, the ring was on her finger, the house was purchased, and life was heading down Pleasantville Lane. Everything was perfect.\n\nOr so they thought.\n\nWith help from his parentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inheritance, Nolan takes on a new business adventure, utilizing all his free time. What was once their life- carefree with minimal responsibilities, is no more. When Alexa starts to feel the pressure from school, wedding planning, and lack of help from Nolan, exhaustion kicks in and feelings get hurt, testing the strength of their relationship. But, if there is one thing that Nolan will never compromise, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s AlexaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happiness. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing Nolan Pratt wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do to make sure Alexa is well taken care of, loved, and happy.\n\nWhen NolanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past resurfaces- a past that Alexa didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know existed- will it all be too much? Will NolanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s devotion to AlexaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happiness cost him their relationship and lose him the only thing that has ever mattered in his life? Or will Nolan discover that his past doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t determine his future and he is worth the happiness he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think he deserves?\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05e20a93e9e1790eb835dad3e327a6c3602bf058","amp;dn":"Giving+You+Forever+%28The+Forever+Series+%234%29+by+Ashley+Wilcox+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05e20a93e9e1790eb835dad3e327a6c3602bf058","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,226,10,147,233,225,121,14,184,53,218,211,227,39,166,195,96,43,240,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
