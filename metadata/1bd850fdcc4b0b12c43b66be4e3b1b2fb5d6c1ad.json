There was just the music, and that music could speak louder than any endorsements or MTV reality shows. Groups like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Kinks started a revolution of electrified, snarling rock that would inspire for decades.\n\nUnfortunately, this music was also left up high on a shelf for decades. Until one day, a quartet from rural Denmark dusted off those riffs and brought forth a refreshing brand of pure, unadulterated bluesy rock unheard for too long.\nVocalist/guitarist Steffen Westmark, organist (yes, ORGANIST) Soren Christensen, bassist Allen Villadsen, and drummer Per Jorgenson have revived the chords of a gritty rock attitude, to show people that it was never supposed to be about the drugs and money, but about the power-jam and all-out blues wail that gave shivers. In Denmark, the &quot;blue van&quot; comes to take people to the loony bin - while you&amp;#039;re there, take a shot of Blue Van rock &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; roll.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bd850fdcc4b0b12c43b66be4e3b1b2fb5d6c1ad","amp;dn":"The+Blue+Van-The+Art+Of+Rolling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bd850fdcc4b0b12c43b66be4e3b1b2fb5d6c1ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,216,80,253,204,75,11,18,196,59,102,190,78,59,27,47,181,214,193,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
