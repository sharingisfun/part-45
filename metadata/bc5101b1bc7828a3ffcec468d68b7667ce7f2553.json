They are joined by Jon Clark on French horn and Howard Levy on harmonica and piano, adding a greater melodic range to the music.  Glen plays his usual variety of frame drums (from Spain and Morocco), Egyptian tambourine and various other percussion instruments.  The result is a cross-cultural potpourri of earth-jazz stylings, with Glen's pulsating rhythms leading.  The album ends with a solo on one of Glen's tambourines, revealing his mastery of this instrument that plays such a central role in Arabic music. ~ AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nGlen Velez (Drums and Percussion) \nLayne Redmond (Percussion and Voice) \nSteve Gorn (Bamboo Flute and Flute) \nJohn Clark (French Horn) \nHoward Levy (Harmonica and Piano) \n\nGlen Velez - Assyrian Rose Tracks:\n01  Blue Castle (Glen Velez) 8:08 \n02  Offering to Anubis (Glen Velez/Steve Gorn) 2:25 \n03  Assyrian Rose (Glen Velez) 7:13 \n04  Drala (Glen Velez/Steve Gorn) 9:15 \n05  Amazonas (Glen Velez/Steve Gorn) 9:25 \n06  Wren Chant (Glen Velez) 5:29 \n07  Silver Lining (Glen Velez) 4:26 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc5101b1bc7828a3ffcec468d68b7667ce7f2553","amp;dn":"Glen+Velez+-+Assyrian+Rose+%281989%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc5101b1bc7828a3ffcec468d68b7667ce7f2553","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,81,1,177,188,120,40,163,255,206,196,104,214,139,118,103,206,127,37,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
