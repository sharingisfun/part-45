Stripped \nBody of secretsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nAs a member of the CIAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite, Black Opals, Natalya Trubachev must live a lie, working undercover as the lover of Dmitri, a Russian mob boss. His business is trafficking vulnerable Las Vegas strippers overseas for twisted sex games. NatalyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business is to blow the ring wide open and bring down Dmitri and his American contacts. But the stakes are raised when she learns that the next target is her own sister Kate, a dancer in the famed club Fantasia. Only now does Natalya realize how personal her mission has become, and how far sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willing to go to complete it.\nBody of liesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nThe manager of Fantasia is Brandon Moretti, an undercover detective who keeps a close eye on his girls, and an even closer one on his sinfully sensual hire. For Natalya, working the club could be the break sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been waiting for. But for Moretti, Natalya is a possible link to a killer. Only he never counted on her being so lethally seductive or so dangerous to get close to. As every forbidden pleasure between them is stripped away, his own secrets threaten their security, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s NatalyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that could destroy them both. \n\n2.

When he arrives in Dubai, he discovers his target is Sasha ZabloskyÃ¢â‚¬â€a woman he knows all too well, and who has haunted him ever since their one unforgettable night together. But he finds Sasha reluctant to leave her Sheik, the only true friend sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever known. Only Alexei canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give her a choice.\nA woman of deceptionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nWith their yearning roused by intrigue, Alexei and Sasha can no longer resist and spend night after night in forbidden pleasure. Soon Alexei finds himself falling for her even as he battles a shadowy menace to protect her. But Sasha is no innocent.
