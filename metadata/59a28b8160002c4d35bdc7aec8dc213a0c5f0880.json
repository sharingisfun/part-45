Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear \nSolid 3: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new \nfans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the Metal \nGear Solid franchise.\n\nThe Metal Gear Solid series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, \nand the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon,\nwith over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite \nspecial forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast \njungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a \nspecial forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the \nseries' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill \nof sneaking through enemy territory undetected.\n\nThe Metal Gear Solid series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the \ngameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual \ndevelopments in society.\n\nThese elements have made Metal Gear Solid what it is today: a mature work of entertainment \nthat transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading \nproducts of the Japanese content business.\n\nPlatform: XBOX 360\nRegion: PAL\nFormat: XDG3 (LT2.0 or above)\nSize 2 DVD's\nLanguage: English\nGenre: 3rd Person Shooter\n\nXGD3 BURN GUIDE: http://nickthegr33k.eu/XGD3burn.pdf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59a28b8160002c4d35bdc7aec8dc213a0c5f0880","amp;dn":"Metal+Gear+Solid+HD+Collection+PAL+XBOX360-SWAG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59a28b8160002c4d35bdc7aec8dc213a0c5f0880","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,162,139,129,96,0,44,77,53,189,199,174,200,220,33,58,12,95,8,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
