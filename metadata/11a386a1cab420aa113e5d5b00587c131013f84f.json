What does it mean for American foreign policy? How did we get to this point? And what do we do now?\n\nIn Unthinkable, Kenneth Pollack, a former CIA analyst with twenty-five years of experience working on the Middle East, explores AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intractable problem with Iran, TehranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability, and the proÃ‚Â­longed clash that led us to this point. Pollack lays out key solutions to the Iran nuclear quesÃ‚Â­tion, explaining and assessing the options for American policymakers: \n\n* Redoubling our efforts at a carrot-and-stick approach that combines negotiations and sanctions \n* Aiding the Iranian opposition to bring about a popular form of regime change \n* An Israeli military strike \n* The American military option \n* Containing a nuclear Iran \n\nInsightful, powerful, and balanced in its approach, Unthinkable is one of the most thoughtÃ‚Â­ful and important books on foreign policy in the past decade.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;Learned, lucid and deeply sobering.&quot;\n--Kirkus\n\n&quot;[A]n engrossing book...Mr. Pollack has produced an account that is mercifully free of swagger. If Congress gets a vote on going to war with Iran, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hope that this book is on everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reading lists. It might just change a few minds.&quot;\n--The Economist\n\n&quot;Pollack has provided a useful briefing for anyone seeking to better understand what drives Iranian policy. Even more, he tackles the nature of the challenge the country poses to the United States. The book proves a valuable tool for pushing back on claims that containment is just a policy of surrender. In making the case here that containment is the worst possible strategy, except for all the others, Pollack has contributed to a smarter, more reality-based Iran policy debate.&quot;\n--American Prospect\n\n&quot;One of the Best Books of 2013&quot;\n--The Economist\n\n&quot;One of the 100 Notable Books of 2013&quot;\n--The New York Times\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKenneth Pollack is a well-known expert on the Middle East and Persian Gulf and has appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Charlie Rose, C-SPAN, and NPR.
