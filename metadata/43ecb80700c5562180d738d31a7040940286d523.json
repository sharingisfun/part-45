The Germans used the war as an opportunity to develop equipment and tactics, and their force included not only instructors, but also combat units of artillery, tanks and aircraft. These units tested guns, tanks and planes and perfected techniques which were used in the 1940 Blitzkrieg. Many of officers prominent in the early campaigns of World War II won their first successes in Spain. This book details the Legion and its unique uniform and insignia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43ecb80700c5562180d738d31a7040940286d523","amp;dn":"The+Condor+Legion%3A+German+Troops+in+the+Spanish+Civil+War+%28Elite","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43ecb80700c5562180d738d31a7040940286d523","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,236,184,7,0,197,86,33,128,215,56,211,26,112,64,148,2,134,213,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
