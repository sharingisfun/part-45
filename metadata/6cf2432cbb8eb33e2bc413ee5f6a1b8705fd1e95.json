The concise coverage presents a detailed comparison of optical switching technologies, and covers architectural issues together with topics such as signaling protocols and Quality of Service (QoS) provision. Additionally, the book provides deep insight into recent advances in optical circuit switching, optical packet switching (OPS) and optical burst switching (OBS) technologies; their performance advantages, their control-plane specifications, their enabling technologies, their applicability in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s networks, and their cost benefits. Readers need only undergraduate background in computer communication networks on topics related to TCP/IP, SDH and MPLS networks. This text will be a valuable resource for advanced undergraduates, beginning graduates, and researchers studying communications in Engineering and Computer Science.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cf2432cbb8eb33e2bc413ee5f6a1b8705fd1e95","amp;dn":"Enabling+Optical+Internet+with+Advanced+Network+Technologies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cf2432cbb8eb33e2bc413ee5f6a1b8705fd1e95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,242,67,44,187,142,179,62,43,196,19,238,95,106,27,135,5,253,30,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
