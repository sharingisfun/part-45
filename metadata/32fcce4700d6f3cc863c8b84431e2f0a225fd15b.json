He presents himself at the peak of his writing ability and, supported by Peter Asher&amp;#039;s sensitive production, also in full creative control. In spite of numerous cameo appearences (by Andrew Gold, David Crosby and the Eagles) the album failed commercially like on most other instances Souther decided against the role of the man in the background. Many of the songs feature re-recorded (and better) versions of songs he had previously recorded with Linda Ronstadt, others (like the irresistable Doors Swing Open) are clearly meant for his own use, so unapplicable are they to the Eagles&amp;#039; or Ronstadt&amp;#039;s patterns.\n\nInformation Disc:\n?
