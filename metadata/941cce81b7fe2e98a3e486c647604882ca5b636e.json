Unlike the previously released 'Street Fighter II ~ G.S.M. Capcom 4' (PCCB-00056) , 'Street Fighter II Complete File' (CAPCOM-004) and 'Street Fighter II The World Warrior (U.K.)' (SCM-001-02), the Perfect Original Version has each and every BGM tracked individually without any type of sound effect/s added to detract from the music. (hence the title) Without a shadow-of-a-doubt - 'STREET FIGHTER II Perfect Original Version', is rarest and most valuable Street Fighter II CD of them ALL. Unfortunately, 'STREET FIGHTER II Perfect Original Version' was never released as a stand alone soundtrack.\n\nDisc 2 - STREET FIGHTER II Instrumental Arrange Version is basically a retitled &amp; repackaged previously released Street Fighter II soundtrack named - Street Fighter II ~ Image Album (PCCB-00075). The only tracklist differences being that this version comes with two previously un-heard tracks [1 &amp; 12] that cannot be found on any other released Street Fighter II soundtrack.\n\nDisc 3 - STREET FIGHTER II Vocal Arrange Version is based on a previously released Street Fighter II soundtrack named - Nesshou!! Street Fighter II (PCCB-00103) The only tracklist differences being that this version comes with an added extra track included. The track in question (track 13) can be heard on 'Street Fighter II Complete File' (CAPCOM-004).\n------------------------------------------------------------\nOnly 2000 Street Fighter II Collector's Box's were ever produced, each one printed with its own unique identification serial number for authenticity.\n\nFor Street Fighter II merchandise collector's and fanatics, this is the ultimate collectable item.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nNever released outside of Japan.\nBox comes with wrap-around obi strip.\nCan sell for anywhere between $100 - $400","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:941cce81b7fe2e98a3e486c647604882ca5b636e","amp;dn":"STREET+FIGHTER+II+Collectors+BOX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"941cce81b7fe2e98a3e486c647604882ca5b636e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,28,206,129,183,254,46,152,163,228,134,198,71,96,72,130,202,91,99,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
