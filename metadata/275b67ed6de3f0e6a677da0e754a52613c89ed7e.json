Maztek, born and raised in the heart of Italy, Rome, he embarked upon his music career at the young age of 13 as a lead guitarist and percussionist.\n\nAt 18 years of age he became fascinated with electronic music, specifically Techno and Drum and Bass. He decided to take heed and began to compose not only Drum and Bass but also Electro, Grime and Dubstep tracks and played them out in the Italian underground scene with great success and response.\n\nIn 2005, Maztek formed the label Ã¢â‚¬ËœSubculture RecordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, that captivated a wide international audience and became a known vinyl and digital label and has had releases from artists such as, N.phect, Future Signal, Proktah, Malsum &amp; Sleeper Cell.\n\nYou can hear Maztek's releases on Ã¢â‚¬ËœSubculture RecordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as well as many other labels such as, Ã¢â‚¬ËœContaminatedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœClose2deathÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœBasswerkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Italian labels Ã¢â‚¬ËœModulateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœTransistor TechnologyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to name a few.\n\nMaztek has also collaborated with a number of well known producers such as Aeph, Optiv, Sleeper Cell, Dabs, Billian, N.phect and Malsum, to name a few.\n\nMaztek's remix catalogue is also increasing; he has done remixes for artists like Intiman, Foreign Beggars and is in the process of doing a remix for N.phect.\n\nHis biggest releases yet, Intiman ft. Foreign Beggars, Ã¢â‚¬ËœHit ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Maztek remix) and Ã¢â‚¬ËœStraight to BadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, have caught the attention of many all around the world and has been supported by all major DjÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s such as, Ed Rush, The Upbeats, State of Mind, amongst many others.\n\nIn 2011, he became one of the official producers of Dope D.O.D., a hip hop crew based in the Netherlands, and in that same year he made a remix for an Italian band called Subsonica. The track was Ã¢â‚¬Å“Il Diluvio (Maztek remix)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and was released by EMI. Another remix was made for a band called VOV and was released by Warner. Beyond these huge releases, in 2012, Maztek signs Ã¢â‚¬Å“GalacticaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“OdysseyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on Renegade Hardware that is one of the most famous labels in the UK established in 1995. He is also working on a single for Andy CÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Program Records and Tony Colman's Hospital Records as well...plus another EP for Ed RushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Piranha Pool.\n\nWith Dope D.O.D. he made another 4 beats coming out on their new album in early 2013. One of the beats will feature Jonatan Davis from Korn.\n\nMaztek's sound is supported by big names such as Andy C, Ed Rush, Delta Heavy, June Miller, Black Sun Empire, State of Mind to name a few.\n\nMaztek is hot property and is ready to proceed in what has been proving to be a long and amazing career.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:275b67ed6de3f0e6a677da0e754a52613c89ed7e","amp;dn":"Maztek+-+Unreleased+Stuffs+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"275b67ed6de3f0e6a677da0e754a52613c89ed7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,91,103,237,109,227,240,230,166,119,218,14,117,74,82,97,60,137,237,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
