Open the RAR file with Winrar or whatever you use. Go into the opened folder and install the program &amp; restart your computer before applying anything. \n\n2. Go to the &quot;Crack&quot; folder and right-click and copy the &quot;TMPGEncDVDAuthor3.exe&quot; file. \n\n3. Go to C:/Program Files/Pegasys Inc/TMPGEnc DVD Author 3 with DivX Authoring and right-click on an empty space and click &quot;paste&quot;...a pop-up will ask you if you want to replace the other file with the newer one...click &quot;YES&quot; and then you can close that folder. \n\n4. Go back to the &quot;Crack&quot; folder and right-click &amp; copy the &quot;TMPGEncDVDAuthor3.en.lic&quot; file and then go to C:/Documents and Setting/User/Application Data/Pegasys Inc/TMPGEncDVDAuthor3 folder and paste and replace the other file with the new one the same way you did with the other file...close the folder and you&amp;#039;re good to go. \n\nWindows, by default, hides the &quot;Application Data&quot; folder so if you cannot see it, then go to &quot;Tools&quot; at the top of the folder &amp; on the drop down menu click &quot;Folder Options&quot; then click on the &quot;View&quot; tab...go down and check the &quot;Show hidden files and folders&quot; option...click &quot;Apply&quot; and then &quot;Ok&quot;...you should now be able to see the &quot;Application Data&quot; folder. \n\nAnother thing that you may find is that when you go to C:/Documents and Setting/user/Apllication Data/Pegasus Inc you may not see the &quot;TMPGEncDVDAuthor3&quot; folder which happened to me...all I did was start the TMPGEnc program and it will pop up wanting a serial number...after it pops up just exit the program and go back to the C:/Documents and Settings/user/Application Data/Pegusus Inc folder and you should now see the &quot;TMPGEncDVDAuthor3&quot; folder where you need to paste the &quot;TMPGEncDVDAuthor3.en.lic&quot; file...do that now and close the folder and you&amp;#039;re all set. Also when I say C:/Documents and Settings/User \n\n\n\n\nballing-n-nt\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:143380df4d23e7a16b464759d631abb44a988985","amp;dn":"TMPGEnc.DVD.Author.3.with.DivX.Authoring.v3.0.5.149","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"143380df4d23e7a16b464759d631abb44a988985","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,51,128,223,77,35,231,161,107,70,71,89,214,49,171,180,74,152,137,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
