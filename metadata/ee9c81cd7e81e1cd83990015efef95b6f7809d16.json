I personally converted the game from the CDs and I could guarantee you guys that this game really works from start to finish. Unlike some of the RE2 versions that you could download here that freezes once you reach the Police Station, this game will run very smoothly.\n\n\nWhat you will need to play this game:\n\n1. A CUSTOM-FIRMWARE PlayStation Portable (I tested it on version 3.95 GEN2)\n2. The POPS LOADER PLUGIN (set it to version 3.52)\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. Download the Popsloader at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4075732/Full_3.90_working_popsloader_for_PSP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4075732/Full_3.90_working_popsloader_for_PSP&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2. Extract the file and then put the entire &quot;seplugins&quot; folder to your memory stick's root directory.\n\n3. Turn on your PSP whilst holding the R button. The RECOVERY MENU should appear.\n\n4. Go to PLUGINS and then enable Pops Loader.\n\n5. Restart your PSP and then start RE2. The Leon and Claire folders should be in the right locations for them to show up in the PSP menu (x:/psp/game/). Press and hold R again as soon as you load the game. The Pops Loader should appear and then choose version 3.52.\n\nIT'S FOR VERSION 3.9 M33-2 BY THE WAY. \n\nShould you have any questions about the pops loader thing, feel free to leave a comment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee9c81cd7e81e1cd83990015efef95b6f7809d16","amp;dn":"Resident+Evil+2+for+PSP+%28Guaranteed+100%25+Working%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee9c81cd7e81e1cd83990015efef95b6f7809d16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,156,129,205,126,129,225,205,131,153,0,21,239,239,149,182,247,128,157,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
