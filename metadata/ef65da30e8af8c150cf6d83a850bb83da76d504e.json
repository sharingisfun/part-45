Despite almost twenty years as a stand-up comedian and radio personality, Duran is a mere blip on the showbiz radar and in recent years a faint memory to anybody who knew him in the past. Shows are rare and his long awaited Ã¢â‚¬ËœHow EmbarrassingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ film is still being worked on to this day. Duran insists he will emerge again on commercial radio and on stage better than ever.Few care about Duran except for a handful of Britney Spears fans who know he penned BritneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most notorious unreleased track Ã¢â‚¬Å“RebellionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. When Duran broke his silence early in 2013 he had fans wishing death on him for not leaking the full track which is said to be in his archives with thousands of other songs heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worked on for years. \n\nMusically JJ Star is harder on the palate then his outrageous stand up and few have praised to his free downloads released in recent years. My attention to Duran was given when I saw his Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Sold My Soul To The IlluminatiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ mix tape getting the same downloads as T.I. and Soulja Boy on Datpiff.com. Here was a middle aged comedian nobody cares about getting over 75,0000 downloads on a hip hop music site. Although Duran copped to boosting those figures, I listened to the mix tape and was fairly impressed. Whether it was spoken word or the Avant garde nature of his compositions, Duran struck me as a cat who marched to his own beat. This 70 minutes plus opus is packed with spoken word, skits, stand up and songs. Although this will unlikely bring mainstream success, it is a poignant entry into the career discography of a misunderstood comedy genius. D.C.
