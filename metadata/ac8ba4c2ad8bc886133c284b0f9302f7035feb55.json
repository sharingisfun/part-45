Linezer0 however believe that everyone     \n     should have the option to backup their program/game and be        \n     able to run it without any problems.                              \n                                                                       \n     Further we do NOT in any way condone the spreading of our         \n     cracks, in other words we do NOT spread the releases to any       \n     websites, P2P networks or any other public available location     \n     and we urge that our releases should not be spread like that      \n     at all.                                                           \n                                                                       \n     We -Linezer0- has nothing to do with the distribution of these    \n     cracks, it is all done by third parties. As such, and             \n     according to the laws where the individuals of Linezer0 reside,   \n     it is not our responsibility what others desides to do with       \n     these releases.

It remains to be seen how     \n     affected you are of the End User License Agreements (EULAs).      \n     They can't supersede domestic laws, remember that.                \n                                                                       \n     According to the &quot;DMCA ACT&quot; in the Unites States, you have no     \n     rights to circumvent a copy protection. Beware, they will         \n     punish you harder than if you stole the shrinkwrapped software    \n     in a mall.
