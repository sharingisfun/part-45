With features including HTML includes, SASS and Coffeescript parsing and Clever Paths, Hammer is an indispensable tool!\n\nHammer has some built in features that happen automatically, and some clever functions you use with special Hammer tags\n\n* HTML Includes\n\nFront-end developers shouldn't have to run local server environments, or use PHP just to put one HTML file inside another. With Hammer, you don't have to.\n\n* Clever Paths\n\nWouldn't it be great if you could just reference an asset by name? Hammer will search your project for the file you reference, and write the file-path for you automagically.\n\n* Variables + Helpers\n\nSet and use variables in your template files and bend your templates to your will. Hammer also adds helpful classes to your HTML link tags, making menu logic a thing of the past.\n\n* Auto Reload\n\nEvery time Hammer finishes compiling your project, it automatically refreshes your browser to show your latest changes and keep things up-to-date.\n\n* SASS + CoffeeScript\n\nHammer knows all about SASS, SCSS &amp; CoffeeScript and will automatically compile them to CSS &amp; JavaScript. You can also use special tags to reference them in the head.\n\n* HAML and Markdown\n\nHammer compiles HAML and Markdown files to HTML for you.\n\n* Publish Builds\n\nWith Hammer's one-click publishing, you can share your work using a unique short URL. Show your clients, get feedback, then iterate quickly and easily.\n\nWhat's New in Version 1.2.0\n\nSuper important: A rogue bug is currently doubling-up @stylesheet and @javascript wildcard (*) tags for some users. We've submitted a fix that should be with you all shortly. \n\n* New features:\n\n* HAML and Markdown formats\n\n* Improved compilation engine\n\n* Under-the-hood tweaks\n\n* Bug fixes\n\n* Window is now 100% more resizable\n\nWhat's New in Version 1.2.1\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Bug fixes for stylesheet and javascript includes\n\nSystem Requirements: \n\nIntel OS version: Requirements: OS X 10.7 or later\nProcessor type(s) &amp; speed: 64-bit processor\n\n---- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef9df61862b4910d09c8a5a49889ed10135b71f0","amp;dn":"Hammer+v.+1.2.1+%5BK%5Dracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef9df61862b4910d09c8a5a49889ed10135b71f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,157,246,24,98,180,145,13,9,200,165,164,152,137,237,16,19,91,113,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
