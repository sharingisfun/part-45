They are four unlikely characters who have united to create something soulful, unexpected, and genuine.\n\nRosie delivers her twisted marriage of mighty melodic vocals and killer gruesome growls with regal determination. KhamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitar saturates their sound with a heaviness and groove unique to modern metal. Johnny empowers the group with punchy, heavy riffs that set their sound unequal to most. BrianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drumming guides the band with energy, skill, and unrelenting power.\n\nDriven by their zealous determination, FHF is here to proclaim something novel. They are influenced by many different artists from Black Label Society to Stone Sour to Godsmack. Yet they are pioneering a new sound all their own that they guarantee you have never heard before.\n\nJanurary 2013 they released a two song demo. Recorded by Matt Mercado (Daisy Chain, Mindbomb) at Sonic Palace Studios and mastered it by Andrew Mikhail (Oceano, Serpents, Defiler).\n\nApril 2014 they released their debut EP. Engineered by Dan Precision (Rise Against, 88 Fingers Louie) and mastered by Brett Hestla (Dark New Day, Framing Hanely). It is now available everywhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69fac4d980b30b2d18af7fd22e1b228a5d7f645c","amp;dn":"False+Hope+Fades+EP+%28Rock%2F2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69fac4d980b30b2d18af7fd22e1b228a5d7f645c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,250,196,217,128,179,11,45,24,175,127,210,46,27,34,138,93,127,100,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
