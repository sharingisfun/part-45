The group disbanded in 2004, but reunited in 2008 for several performances.\n\nThe band was founded by Cam DiNunzio, Jonathan Fuller, Keeley Davis and Maura Davis. They recorded a five song demo in January 2001, and signed with Jade Tree Records later that year.\n\nDenali released their self-titled debut album in 2002. In August 2003, they released their second album The Instinct. Shortly after the album's release, Jonathan Fuller and Keeley Davis left the band to focus their attention on Engine Down. Davis was replaced by Stephen Howard and Ryan Rapsys replaced Fuller. However, the new band configuration ultimately led to Denali breaking up in April 2004. In 2006, Lovitt Records released the DVD Pinnacle, featuring a concert from 2003.\n\nIn November 2004, Maura Davis, Ryan Rapsys, Stephen Howard and new member Matt Clark formed the band Bella Lea. They later changed their name to Ambulette. Maura &amp; Keeley reunited as band members in GlÃƒÂ¶s. They released their debut album through Lovitt Records in 2007.\n\nDenali performed a reunion show on July 5, 2008 at The National Theater in Richmond, Virginia. This was followed by two further shows in New York City in September. In June 2009, two additional shows were performed in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.. A new song was played at these shows, listed online under the name &quot;Church Hill Bricks.&quot; No news as to if they are working on more music since...\n\n\n\nStudio albums:\n\n\n\nDenali (2002) [FLAC] - Track listing:\n\n1.
