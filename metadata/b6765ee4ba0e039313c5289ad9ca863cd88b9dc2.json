The result is a mixed bag of traditional and original songs delivered in an equally mixed variety of styles, and while not all of the experiments are fully successful, taken together they reveal a major talent on the rise. Opening with the heartbreaking 19th century song &quot;The Fairy Boy&quot; (sung like a lullaby, nearly a cappella, with only melancholy drips of piano to accompany her voice), then shifting to a brilliant original song titled &quot;Alice in the Bacon Box,&quot; the album lays out its game plan from the outset. Ward shows herself equally capable of delivering rollicking bawdy songs (&quot;Maids When You're Young&quot;) and Child ballads (&quot;The Two Sisters&quot;), and of writing originals that reflect equally her youth (&quot;F for Love,&quot; the yearning &quot;Julia&quot;) and an unusual maturity (the conceptually complex &quot;Adelphi&quot;). Her way with a melody is not yet fully assured: neither &quot;Julia&quot; nor &quot;Death (Rock Me to Sleep)&quot; offers a tune worth whistling. But her nascent capabilities as a songwriter are perhaps best indicated by the album's closing track, &quot;Bricks and Love,&quot; for which she appropriates the chorus of &quot;Bheir Mi O,&quot; one of the sweetest and saddest of the Gaelic laments, and builds around it the account of a widower she met in a folk club. The song is gorgeous and deeply affecting and in every way wonderful, and will leave you waiting anxiously to hear what Lucy Ward comes up with next.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6765ee4ba0e039313c5289ad9ca863cd88b9dc2","amp;dn":"Lucy+Ward+-+Adelphi+Has+to+Fly+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6765ee4ba0e039313c5289ad9ca863cd88b9dc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,118,94,228,186,14,3,147,19,197,40,154,217,202,134,60,216,139,157,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
