He never again seemed as convincing in his grasp of Americana music and themes, never again seemed as individual, and never again did his limited, slurred bluesy voice seem as ingratiating. He never again topped his triptych of &quot;A Song for You,&quot; &quot;Hummingbird,&quot; and &quot;Delta Lady,&quot; nor did his albums contain such fine tracks as &quot;Dixie Lullaby.&quot; Throughout it all, what comes across is Russell's idiosyncratic vision, not only in his approach but in his very construction -- none of the songs quite play out as expected, turning country, blues, and rock inside out, not only musically but lyrically. Yes, his voice is a bit of an acquired taste, but it's only appropriate for a songwriter with enough chutzpah to write songs of his own called &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; and &quot;Give Peace a Chance.&quot; And if there ever was a place to acquire a taste for Russell, it's here.\n\n~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Leon-Russell-Leon-Russell/release/1235856&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Leon-Russell-Leon-Russell/release/1235856&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRipped by MidnightRocker with EAC, from the factory-pressed silver CD.\nCompressed with FLAC, using Frontend 1.7.1 - level 8.\nIncludes noncompliant wav and flac CUE files and single wav CUE file.\nComplete art includes; covers, insert, disc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c5b7c588bfa14b901802e94d07e39e5afb4c9ea","amp;dn":"Leon+Russell+-+Leon+Russell+%281970%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c5b7c588bfa14b901802e94d07e39e5afb4c9ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,91,124,88,139,250,20,185,1,128,46,148,208,126,57,229,175,180,201,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
