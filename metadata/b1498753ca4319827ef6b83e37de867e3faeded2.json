On the night of November 26, Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorists attacked targets throughout the city, including the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most exclusive luxury hotels. For sixty-eight hours, hundreds were held hostage as shots rang out and an enormous fire raged. When the smoke cleared, thirty-one people were dead and many more had been injured. Only the courageous actions of staff and guestsÃ¢â‚¬â€including Mallika Jagad, Bob Nichols, and Taj general manager Binny KangÃ¢â‚¬â€prevented a much higher death toll.\n\nWith a deep understanding of the region and its politics and a narrative flair reminiscent of Midnight in Peking, journalists Cathy Scott-Clark and Adrian Levy vividly unfold the tragic events in a real-life thriller filled with suspense, tragedy, history, and heroism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1498753ca4319827ef6b83e37de867e3faeded2","amp;dn":"Siege_+The+Attack+on+the+Taj+Mumbai%2C+The","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1498753ca4319827ef6b83e37de867e3faeded2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,73,135,83,202,67,25,130,126,246,184,62,55,222,134,126,63,174,222,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
