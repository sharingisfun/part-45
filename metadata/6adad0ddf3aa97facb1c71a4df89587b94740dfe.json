Ali's solo output has been decidedly more rock-edged than her work with the PimpsÃ¢â‚¬â€the once-familiar trip-hop-style drum programming is padded with layers of compressed electric guitars and goth-pop imagery. The ambient ballad &quot;In Praise Of Shadows,&quot; &quot;Grafitti Boy,&quot; which could have been a track on Gwen Stefani's Love. Angel. Music. Baby., and the title track, with its dirgy backbeat and acoustic guitars, should sate fans of the Pimps' surprisingly durable Becoming X (much of that album still sounds fresh in '05Ã¢â‚¬â€drop a few tracks, particularly the mod-rock hit &quot;6 Underground&quot; and &quot;Walking Zero,&quot; onto your iPod and see how they fare next to newer material like Ashanti's &quot;Only U&quot; or Amber's &quot;You Move Me&quot;). But as a whole, Psychic Cat is a little too cohesive for its own goodÃ¢â‚¬Â¦in a low-budget home-studio kind of way. The socially conscious &quot;Speakers&quot; is admirable but the lyrics are contrived at best: &quot;It's time to stand up and start speakin'/Yeah shake up the devil you're keepin'.&quot; Ali would be better off using her feline powers for evil.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6adad0ddf3aa97facb1c71a4df89587b94740dfe","amp;dn":"Kelli+Ali+-+Psychic+Cat+%5B2004%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6adad0ddf3aa97facb1c71a4df89587b94740dfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,218,208,221,243,170,151,250,203,28,113,164,223,137,88,123,148,116,13,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
