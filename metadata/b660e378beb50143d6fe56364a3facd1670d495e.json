Jobless and in debt, Burke moves back in with his parents in a quaint New Hampshire town, telling them that he's on vacation. Burke's descent into humility continues when he takes a job at his father's &quot;Rocky Road&quot; ice-cream truck business, competing for his old route with a teenager. Oh, and he discovers that his former girlfriend is now dating his old rival. Eventually, as he settles in, Burke rediscovers the charm of home and learns how alike fathers and sons can be. \n\nCast: \n\nMark Salling ... Harrison Burke \n \nSteve Byers ...
