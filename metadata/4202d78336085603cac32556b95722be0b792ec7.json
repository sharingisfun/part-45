Use your helium filled balloons to fly through diverse, colorful environments and collect all the stars. Watch out for birds, ninjas and spikey things and don't fall into the water!\n\nHelium Boy features full 3D graphics with a cute artstyle. 8 challenging stages, all with unique environments and different types of gameplay. Full 3D gameplay, as well as a couple of traditional sidescrolling stages. \n\nTwo difficulty modes: in beginner mode you can play the stages at you own pace and easily collect all the stars, but in normal mode the screen is scrolling automatically and constantly forces you to move forward, so you have to find the perfect route to get all the stars before they leave the screen.\n\nControls:\n\nThe game can be played with an onscreen gamepad or with a harware keyboard or gamepad. Touch the directional pad to move in the character in any direction. Press the Jump button repeatedly to fly with the balloons. \nIf the balloons pop, press the Pump button to get new ones, or jump around without them. You can also let go of the balloons at any time by pressing the Drop button.\n\nXPERIA PLAY Optimized\nSupports HTC Evo 3D\n\nIf the game runs slowly, try reducing the screen size in the options menu.\n\nWhat's New:\n\nAdded Stereoscopic 3D support for HTC Evo 3D\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=beril.mootor.helium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=beril.mootor.helium&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4202d78336085603cac32556b95722be0b792ec7","amp;dn":"Helium+Boy+v1.07","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4202d78336085603cac32556b95722be0b792ec7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,2,215,131,54,8,86,3,202,195,37,86,185,87,34,190,11,121,46,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
