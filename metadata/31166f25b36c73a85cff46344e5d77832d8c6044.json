I have transcoded every lossless file with the highest FLAC quality.\n\nFile naming scheme: (year - album/track - date), suitable even for cheap music players. Every album contains artwork (cover.jpg at the very least). Artwork was also reduced to a decent file size. I have also removed all the useless extra crap (nfo, m3u, txt, log) and converted complete disc rips to one track per file storage scheme, thus also removing the cue sheets. I like my music folders clean and my stuff organized.\n\nIllwill is due to be released on 29, so only a 320 CBR MP3 album was found.
