Het enige doel waar Joy nog ÃƒÂ©cht voor leeft is het \nvinden van haar biologische moeder. Deze zoektocht naar iets of iemand om aan vast te klampen, \ndreigt Joy fataal te worden.\n\nJoy is an emotionally damaged young woman of eighteen, who was given up at birth, to grow up in \nhomes and with foster families. She lives on the fringes of society, getting by on benefits and earning \na little extra by playing the accordion in the subway. In addition, she is a skilled shoplifter and has \nnever been caught. The film follows her closely during her dogged search for her unknown biological \nmother. Joy has a rather distant quality and the only times we see her animated is during her \nobsessive attempts to discover the identity and address of her mother. She clings to her conviction \nthat she was the product of a loving relationship and that is why her mother called her Joy. This \nbelief is all she has to hang onto in life. Her other activities revolve around her friend, Denise (16), \nwho has got pregnant on purpose and is living in the home from which Joy was expelled because of \nbad behaviour, and her boyfriend Momo (21), a second-generation immigrant who was born and \nbred in Holland. Joy's search for her biological mother, have led her to an old address; on the basis of \na vague physical resemblance, she assumes that the woman she finds there is her mother. She starts \nto follow the woman on her way to work and during shopping trips, and watches the house where \nshe lives with her teenage daughter. Joy becomes more cheerful and more alert, and begins to \ndevelop an eye for the world around her - giving us a glimpse of the young woman she could have \nbecome if she had had a bit more luck. Then she hears someone call the woman by her name - a \ndifferent name from that of her biological mother. She is profoundly shocked: her world seems to \ncollapse around her.\n\nSource: DVD5 Retail\nSize: 702 MB\nForm: AVI\nVideo Codec:  XVID\nBitrate: 1324 Kbit/s\nWidth &amp; Heights:  720 x 400\nFrames/s: 25.000 Fps\nAudio:  Dutch\nAudio Code: mp3\nBitrate: 128  kbps\nChannels:  2\nSampling: 48.0 kHz \n\nCategorie: Beeld\nFormaat: DivX\nTaal: Nederlands gesproken en ondertiteld (ingebakken/hardcoded)\nGenre:  Drama\n\nDeze review wordt u aangeboden door:\n\nDUTCH MOVIE THEATER","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61db7df4cb9868f21ca1b05e9f90aa566303618f","amp;dn":"Joy+%282010%29+DVDR%28xvid%29+NL+Gespr%2BNL+Subs+DMT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61db7df4cb9868f21ca1b05e9f90aa566303618f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,219,125,244,203,152,104,242,28,161,176,94,159,144,170,86,99,3,97,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
