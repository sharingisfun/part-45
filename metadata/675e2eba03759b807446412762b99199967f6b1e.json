With a little help from the internet, I discovered a complete list of every song played over the ending credits of each episode (thanks to one Tim Copsa, courtesy http://adventureworld.typepad.com/adventureworld/2004/05/deadwood_music.html).\n\nI have spent a lot of time searching for these tracks. I hope that other people may benefit from my effort. I have re-titled each track with their associated episode number and leveled the volume for ease of listening.\n\nAlso: if you have a copy of one of the few remaining tracks, or some of the incidental music from the series, please contact me. Nothing would please me more than to have this be a perfectly complete collection.\n\nIf you are interested in helping, the following tracks are missing:\nEpisode 16 - The Fox by Bill Staines, off the album &quot;One More River&quot;\nEpisode 18 - Pretty Polly by Hilarie Burhans, off the album &quot;Put On the Skillet&quot;\nEpisode 26 - Hole In The Wall by Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry, off the album &quot;A Long Way From Home\nEpisode 32 - O Death by Alan Lomax and Bessie Jones, off the album &quot;Presenting the Alan Lomax Collection&quot;\n\nEnjoy, and please seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:675e2eba03759b807446412762b99199967f6b1e","amp;dn":"Deadwood+Music+Collection+for+All+Seasons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"675e2eba03759b807446412762b99199967f6b1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,94,46,186,3,117,155,128,116,70,65,39,98,185,145,153,150,127,107,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
