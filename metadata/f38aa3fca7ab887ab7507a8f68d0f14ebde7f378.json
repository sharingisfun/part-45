The devil, after all, is in the detail, particularly on the second \ndisc (self-deprecatingly entitled Miss), which really traverses the whole gamut of Peter Gabriels \nglobally-visioned artistry. It includes recent soundtrack work (the haunting &quot;Cloudless&quot; from \nLong Walk Home: Music from the Rabbit-Proof Fence), material from 2002's sterling Up \n(&quot;Signal To Noise&quot;, featuring a compelling vocal from the late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and some \nominous string arrangements, really does sound like a thinking man's Massive Attack) and goes \nright back to that fourth album when marrying the reticence of cold, synthesised new wave with \ninsistent African percussion seemed like a good idea (it was). The first disc--including the \nMTV smash &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, anti-apartheid war cry &quot;Biko&quot;, &quot;Big Time&quot; (interesting how the \nstyles of Gabriel and his former group Genesis seem to converge at this time) and &quot;Games Without \nFrontiers&quot;--really speaks for itself, although with hindsight it seems the single-buying \npublic-at-large had a particular taste for a certain kind of Peter Gabriel record. \nUniversally excellent throughout, the collection is rendered even more desirable by the \ninclusion of three previously unreleased tracks: a live rendition of &quot;Downside Up&quot;, a shorter \nversion of &quot;Blood of Eden&quot; and &quot;Burn You Up, Burn You Down&quot;, latterly included on a video game \nand initially earmarked for the Up album but jettisoned at the last minute. --Kevin Maidment\n\n\n\n\n\n   1.
