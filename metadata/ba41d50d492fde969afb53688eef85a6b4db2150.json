Lorre is wonderful as the morally conflicted Raskolnikov, egomaniacal one moment, guilt-ridden the next; and Lucien Ballard's gloomy cinematography perfectly captures the subdued tone and suffocating sense of impending justice.\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: crime and\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 837,957,632 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 01:24:17\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD\nFrame Size ......................................: 576x416 (AR: 1.385)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1191 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.199 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\nmy rip, thanks dansms for the dvdfull\n\n\nEnglish, spanish, french, greek and finnish subs\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
