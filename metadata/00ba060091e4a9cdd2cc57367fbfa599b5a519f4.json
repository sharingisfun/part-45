What it looks like and why we need to take it seriously\n\nThis book draws attention to the &quot;second sexism,&quot; where it exists, how it works and what it looks like, and responds to those who would deny that it exists. Challenging conventional ways of thinking, it examines controversial issues such as sex-based affirmative action, gender roles, and charges of anti-feminism. The book offers an academically rigorous argument in an accessible style, including the careful use of empirical data, and includes examples and engages in a discussion of how sex discrimination against men and boys also undermines the cause for female equality.\n\n304 pages\nPublisher: Wiley-Blackwell; 1 edition (May 15, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0470674512\nISBN-13: 978-0470674512","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00ba060091e4a9cdd2cc57367fbfa599b5a519f4","amp;dn":"The+Second+Sexism+%282012%29+by+David+Benatar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00ba060091e4a9cdd2cc57367fbfa599b5a519f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,186,6,0,145,228,169,205,210,204,87,54,127,191,165,153,181,165,25,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
