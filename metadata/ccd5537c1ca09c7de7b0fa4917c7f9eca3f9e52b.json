He follows moment by moment how the earthquake was generated under the Pacific Ocean, travelled to the Japanese mainland, and the rare conditions that unleashed a tsunami.\nHe also reveals the latest science behind earthquakes - from why we can't predict them, to what causes some of them to reach such power. Iain shows why our civilisation has developed such a dangerous relationship with earthquakes, and why millions of us continue to live in earthquake zones across the world.\n\n[URL=http://desibbrg.org/][IMG]http://desibbrg.org/images/36646976842619953784.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nSource...........: DVB-Rip\nVideo Format.....: XviD\nVideo Resolution.: 720x416\nVideo Bitrate....: 1693 kbps\nVideo Framerate..: 25.000\nAudio Format.....: AC3\nAudio Bitrate....: 128 kbps\nAudio Sample Rate: 48 KHz\nLength...........: 57:01\nSize.............: 747MB\n\nCredits To Original Ripper(Harry65)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccd5537c1ca09c7de7b0fa4917c7f9eca3f9e52b","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon-Japan+Earthquake+2011+XviD+AC3+ESub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccd5537c1ca09c7de7b0fa4917c7f9eca3f9e52b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,213,83,124,28,160,156,125,231,176,250,73,23,199,249,236,163,249,229,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
