Grant, Cindy Ames, Ken Scott, John Sutton, Philip Ober.\n\n\nGregory Peck stars as the great American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald in this film based on a memoir by Sheilah Graham, who was Fitzgerald's paramour during his final days. Graham (played by Deborah Kerr) was a gossip columnist and aspiring novelist who met Fitzgerald during his latter days as a Hollywood screenwriter. Deep in debt thanks to his wife's stay in a mental hospital and his daughter's private school tuition, Fitzgerald took a job writing film scripts to pay the bills, as he attempted to complete another novel that would re-establish his position as one of the important American authors of his century. Graham became Fitzgerald's aid and inspiration as he tried to steer himself away from alcohol and focus on his work, but the author was no longer as strong or stable as he once was. While Graham and Fitzgerald were in love, they often fought, and their efforts came to naught when he died of heart failure before completing The Last Tycoon, with Graham at his side. Eddie Albert co-stars as Carter, a character based on Fitzgerald's close friend Robert Benchley. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:600bb547cdb92fa54b4f61a7b4032b00cd49b1d7","amp;dn":"Beloved+infidel+%28+1959%29+%5BDVDRip+Dual+Eng-Esp%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"600bb547cdb92fa54b4f61a7b4032b00cd49b1d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,11,181,71,205,185,47,165,75,79,97,167,180,3,43,0,205,73,177,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
