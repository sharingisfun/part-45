The UFB has been trying to make the Colony part of them but a group led by a man named Matthias and rumor is that a UFB security man, Hauser is helping them but word is that he is dead. Douglas Quaid, a man who lives in the Colony who is married to Lori, has been having nightmares of him being in some kind of battle with another woman, that ends with him getting captured. He decides to go to Rekall, a place where a person can experience something by having it implanted in his mind. When the memory he chooses is about to be implanted, it is detected that he has memories of being a spy, that's when they pull guns on him but some UFB security people show up and shoot up the place. Quaid goes home and tells Lori what happened, that's when she tries to kill him. He asks her why is she trying to kill him, she tells him that she's not his wife, she's UFB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56127285449e52bd1a2dec98dd507f5c75e3e2f2","amp;dn":"Total+Recall+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56127285449e52bd1a2dec98dd507f5c75e3e2f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,18,114,133,68,158,82,189,26,45,236,152,221,80,127,92,117,227,226,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
