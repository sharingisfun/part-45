The nice thing about the GBA version of FF VI was that it had an attempt at a better translation and some additional content. One of the big drawbacks however was the music. I found a patch that fixes this, making the music just about as good as it was on the SNES. (Except for the opera music, which had been made outright symphonic. Not even the SNES had that obviously.) Note that the patch will only work with a European rom!\n\nDownload the patch here: http://www.romhacking. net/hacks/657/\n\nIf you don't have Lunar IPS, the program needed to patch the rom, get it here: http://fusoya.eludevisibility. org/lips/\n\nA couple more patches you should know about are one that fixes the color, and a re-translation patch. (Sort of) The GBA version had the colors brightened up a lot since even the SP didn't have the brightest screen. Seeing that on a perfectly bright computer monitor however doesn't look too good. Then there's the translation. The GBA translation is usually considered the better and more accurate one overall, but a number of people feel that certain names and/or lines of dialogue were actually better in the SNES original. There's a patch that kinda mixes the two together. That patch is obviously a bit more geared towards personal taste, but I figured it deserved a mention.\n\nColor restoration patch: http://www.romhacking. net/hacks/765/\n\nTranslation patch: http://www.romhacking. net/hacks/718/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e0e1bed865576dfa48ca76a943604f701a1b5fd","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+VI+Advance+%28E%29%28Eternity%29+Sound+Restoration+Patch%2BC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e0e1bed865576dfa48ca76a943604f701a1b5fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,14,27,237,134,85,118,223,164,140,167,106,148,54,4,247,1,161,181,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
