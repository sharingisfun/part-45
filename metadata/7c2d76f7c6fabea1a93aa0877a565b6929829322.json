Includes 14 songs issued under the Les Fleur de Lys name, singles that they issued under the Rupert's People, Chocolate Frog, and Shyster pseudonyms, and releases on which they backed Sharon Tandy, John Bromley, and Waygood Ellis. It goes without saying that such a manic hodgepodge is geared toward the hardcore collector market. But if you like mid-to-late '60s mod-psych, it's a decent item to have around, with some sparkling (occasionally crazed) guitar work, unusually constructed tunes that sometimes meld soul and psychedelia, and nice harmonies. &quot;Circles&quot; and &quot;Mud in Your Eye&quot; are first-rate pounding mod guitar tunes; &quot;Gong With the Luminous Nose&quot; is pop-psych at its silliest; &quot;Reflections of Charlie Brown&quot; is pop-psych at its most introspective; and Sharon Tandy's &quot;Daughter of the Sun&quot; is a lost near-classic with witchy vocals and sinister psychedelic guitar.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c2d76f7c6fabea1a93aa0877a565b6929829322","amp;dn":"Les+Fleur+De+Lys+-+Reflections+%281965-69%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c2d76f7c6fabea1a93aa0877a565b6929829322","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,45,118,247,198,250,190,161,169,58,160,135,122,86,91,105,41,130,147,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
