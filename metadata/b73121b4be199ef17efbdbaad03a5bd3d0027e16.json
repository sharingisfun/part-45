I consider important episodes to be\n\n    -When Ash catches, evolves, releases, or trades a Pokemon.\n\n    -When Ash wins a gym battle and gains a badge.\n\n    -All of the battles in the final league of a season.\n\n    -When Ash's friends join or leave him.\n\n    -Any episode required to give these events context.\n\nI just finished watching all the episodes in the list and it works so well. I didn't even notice that episodes were being skipped after a while and you can really get a feel of Ash's progression as a trainer. Hopefully this will be helpful to others like me that wanted to get back into the show but couldn't be bothered with all the filler episodes. This list cuts 700+ episodes down to around 170 important episodes.\n\nTHIS TORRENT DOES NOT HAVE ALL THE EPISODES OF POKEMON! IT ONLY HAS EPISODES IN MY LIST. THE LIST IS IN THE TORRENT.\n\nThe files in this torrent have been taken from other torrents I found on pirate bay and other sites. I just wanted to make it easier for people to find all the episodes in this list. No disrespect to these other torrenters and encoders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b73121b4be199ef17efbdbaad03a5bd3d0027e16","amp;dn":"Pokemon+Fast+Track+Viewing+List","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b73121b4be199ef17efbdbaad03a5bd3d0027e16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,49,33,180,190,25,158,241,126,251,219,170,208,58,91,211,208,2,126,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
