And while the young vocal star's good looks are smart enough for a boy band, his muse seems to have sprung from a more sassy and compelling musical era. Mentored by Paul Anka (whose 1950s hit &quot;Put Your Head on My Shoulder&quot; is covered in dreamy, cabaret fashion here), BublÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© sings in the orbits of Darin and Sinatra, covering swing epoch gems (&quot;Come Fly with Me&quot;, &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;, &quot;That's All&quot;) and rock-era standards (Van Morrison's &quot;Moondance&quot;, &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot; by the Brothers Gibb, Queen's &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;) with equal aplomb. David Foster's production is typically slick and played to the back row of the bleachers, but it's informed by smart contexts provided by such arrangers as Johnny Mandel, Randy Waldman and Mike Melvoin. If the choices of material are sometimes staid and predictable, they also give the singer a crucial framework for building toward something more challenging; his is a bright future.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Fever\n[02] Moondance\n[03] Kissing A Fool\n[04] For Once In My Life\n[05] How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\n[06] Summer Wind\n[07] You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine\n[08] Crazy Little Thing Called Love\n[09] Put Your Head On My Shoulder\n[10] Sway\n[11] The Way You Look Tonight\n[12] Come Fly With Me\n[13] That's All\n \nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:48m:53s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 117mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v8.0.2.20 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Easy Listening Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 11 February 2003\nRecord Company\t&gt; Reprise Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.michaelbuble.com\n\t&gt;\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bubl%C3%A9 \n\t&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/b/buble.html \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://www.ilike.com/artist/Michael+Bubl%C3%A9 \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/michaelbuble \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt;[Sway]\n\t&gt;[Fever]\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e01c87f34ac084ecacc9d52e531fd7af8edb6221","amp;dn":"%5B2003%5D+Michael+Bubl%C3%83%C2%A9+-+Michael+Bubl%C3%83%C2%A9+117mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e01c87f34ac084ecacc9d52e531fd7af8edb6221","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,28,135,243,74,192,132,236,172,201,213,46,83,31,215,175,142,219,98,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
