I have scanned the cover which is the same for front and back of the box. I have omitted the 80 page book that is included with the set because it would take me hours to scan. If you want the book bad enough then buy the box set. I will upload one disc a day. This set is a combination of the soundtrack and follow up album with the exception Ten Years After and Rock and Soul Music by Country Joe and the Fish. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Woodstock-Years-Back-Yasgurs-Limited/dp/B002E2QHBS/ref=pd_sim_d_8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Woodstock-Years-Back-Yasgurs-Limited/dp/B002E2QHBS/ref=pd_sim_d_8&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you have difficulty with burning these you should shorten the file names and edit the cue sheet.\n\nIf I have the bandwidth I may be able to upload 2 discs per day. Check back later.\n\nPlease help seed these torrents.
