Hard Rock music is not usually performed by girl bands. That's why this group have a lot of fans all over Russia.\n\nThe song &quot;Night Witches&quot; is devoted to Soviet women pilots (in fact - very young girls) who fought in the slow-moving aircraft Po-2. Low altitude and silence made them invisible. That's why Nazis called them Night Witches and were very afraid. These young girls was very Brave and Real Heroes.\n\n&quot;Night Witches&quot; is the English translation of Nachthexen, a World War II German nickname (Russian Ãï¿½ÃÂ¾Ã‘â€¡ÃÂ½Ã‘â€¹ÃÂµ ÃÂ²ÃÂµÃÂ´Ã‘Å’ÃÂ¼Ã‘â€¹), for the female military aviators of the 588th Night Bomber Regiment, known later as the 46th &quot;Taman&quot; Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment, of the Soviet Air Forces. The regiment was formed by Colonel Marina Raskova and led by Major Yevdokia Bershanskaya.\n\nThe regiment flew harassment bombing and precision bombing missions against the German military from 1942 to the end of the war. At its largest size, it had 40 two-person crews. It flew over 23,000 sorties and is said to have dropped 3,000 tons of bombs. It was the most highly-decorated female unit in the Soviet Air Force, each pilot having flown over 1,000 missions by the end of the war and twenty-three having been awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union title. Thirty of its members died in combat.\n\nA stealth technique of the night bombers was to idle the engine near the target and glide to the bomb release point, with only wind noise to reveal their location. Because of the weight of the bombs and the low altitude of flight the pilots carried no parachutes. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ebb74056775b2fdb158c6e6e5b3ec2d6f72260c","amp;dn":"Aella+-+Night+Witches%2C+Hard+Rock%2C+music+clip+2013%2C+Russian+Girls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ebb74056775b2fdb158c6e6e5b3ec2d6f72260c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,187,116,5,103,117,178,253,177,88,198,230,229,179,236,45,111,114,38,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
