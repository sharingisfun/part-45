What he lacked in charisma and photogenic looks, Orbison made up for in spades with his quavering operatic voice and melodramatic narratives of unrequited love and yearning. In the process, he established rock &amp; roll archetypes of the underdog and the hopelessly romantic loser. These were not only amplified by peers such as Del Shannon and Gene Pitney, but also influenced future generations of roots rockers such as Bruce Springsteen and Chris Isaak, as well as modern country stars the Mavericks.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nGrabber:\t\tExact Audio Copy 1.0 Beta 3\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nLabel:\t\t\tCBS\nCat.#:\t\t\tAGK 45116\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info\n\n\n01.Only The Lonely\n02.Leah\n03.In Dreams\n04.Uptown\n05.It's Over\n06.Crying\n07.Dream Baby\n08.Blue Angel\n09.Working For The Man\n10.Candy Man\n11.Running Scared\n12.Falling\n13.Love Hurts\n14.Shahadaroba\n15.I'm Hurtin'\n16.Mean Woman Blues\n17.Pretty Paper\n18.The Crowd\n19.Blue Bayou\n20.Oh, Pretty Woman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
