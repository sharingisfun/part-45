This bug resulted in a crash due to write permissions. \nLantern Forge should now properly decode these letters, fixing the access issue. \n\nA minor bug was with the button alignment in windowed mode. This should now work correctly. \n\n\nNew Feature \nLots of players have suggested keyboard movement. This has now been added. \nThere is a move-forward key (Default W) that will cause your player to move toward the mouse cursor. \nThat should make it easier to move around in tight spaces without clicking! \n\n\nUpdated Art \nA number of art assets have been updated or added. A noteworthy one is the copper lamppost. \nYou can craft the lamppost on a copper anvil. It has a larger light radius than the standard torches and candles. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1a3fb4af6c5885438e2028f3bbcef30fde589c8","amp;dn":"Lantern+Forge+FULL+v1.05+ENG%2CFR%2CSPA+x64+%5Brepack+by+Lasurie%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1a3fb4af6c5885438e2028f3bbcef30fde589c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,163,251,74,246,197,136,84,56,226,2,143,59,188,239,48,253,229,137,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
