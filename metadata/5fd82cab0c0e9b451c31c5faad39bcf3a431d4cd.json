BernsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thesis that Ã¢â‚¬Å“power accrues to the literateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ should not be taken simplistically; his larger arguments are learned and elegantly made. His occasional invocation of modern phenomena in a nonmodern context (at one point, in discussing events two millennia past, referencing the Second Amendment) lend charm and clarity to what might have otherwise been dauntingly erudite. Instead, Bernstein offers an accessible, quite enjoyable, and highly informative read that will hold surprises even for those familiar with some of the history he covers. --Mark Levine --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fd82cab0c0e9b451c31c5faad39bcf3a431d4cd","amp;dn":"William+Bernstein+-+Masters+of+the+word+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fd82cab0c0e9b451c31c5faad39bcf3a431d4cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,216,44,171,12,14,155,69,28,49,197,250,173,57,188,243,164,49,212,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
