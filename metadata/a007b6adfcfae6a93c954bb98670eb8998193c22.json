Over the period of a year, Werner Herzog has interviewed inmates in America as they await their death and uncovered brutal stories of rape and murder. The second portrait is of James Barnes. Sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife, Barnes had already spent eight years behind bars when he became a practising Muslim.\n(Part 2 of 3, Subtitles, 2012, 4 Star)\n\nDirector: Werner Herzog\n\n==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch\nxvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide\nthe knob a little to the right (not too much) it\nreally makes a big difference to the video output\ntry it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org\nit rid the noise and washed out feel and\nbrighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU\nacceleration can really help playback speeds\ntry this before complaining about corrupted video\nand bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids\nworse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better\nhowever Im still wondering if ver 1.11.1 plays\nbetter as it seems more smooth. MPC with K-lite is\ngood to but lacks the sharpener filter VLC has\n===================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a007b6adfcfae6a93c954bb98670eb8998193c22","amp;dn":"Death.Row.S01E02.hdtv.xvid-%5D%5B+James+Barnes+%5D%5B+29-Mar-2012+%5D+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a007b6adfcfae6a93c954bb98670eb8998193c22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,7,182,173,252,250,230,169,60,149,75,185,134,112,235,137,152,25,60,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
