I hope you like them.\n\nDON'T SELL THE SUCKERS!!!  \n\n***************************************************\n\nPics/Video taken with a Canon Powershot SX280HS.  I was able to optically zoom up to 20X (no digital used since it sucks).  I took the pics at 1600 ISO to make the shots as clear as possible. \n\nPhoto compression set to Super Fine\n\nRecording Pixels set to:  12m 4000x3000\n\nHD Video: 1920x1080 @ 30fps\n\n\n\n***************************************************\n\n\nI was there on the side of the stage (117 section)........Best show I've seen since U2 360 tour and the Police reunion........It was worth every penny!!!\n\n\nI took close to 800 pictures at this show.  I filtered out TONS of them and chose the ones that I thought were best and hopefully not too boring for you guys.\n\n\nThe shots included in the folder look pretty good despite their fog machines on both ends of the stage.\n\nThe brief video/audio clips I took actually sounded pretty good.  I was expecting muffled distortion but was pleasantly surprised.\n\nMy HD video on the Canon was killing my battery that I purchased yesterday.  I bought the best camera Best Buy had yesterday before I went to the show.  I didn't realize there had been reports of bugs/issues with the Canon SX280HS shooting video.  I should have had AT LEAST 25 minutes worth.  (Canon is working to release a firmware update to fix this crap)....Needless to say, I was STEAMED when this happened!\n\nThe HD video I was able to get was inserted in here.  It's nice to check out a few moments here and there.\n\nI'm sure a DVD will be coming out after this tour.  Paul needs more money to buy a small country.  :)\n\n\n\n\n***** I'm a TOTAL amateur photographer, but if there are a few you like, feel free to have them printed or whatever.  ******","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55d13bb8cd86cdb29279f69393a89f79f6774095","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+2013-05-19+-+Amway+Center+in+Orlando%2C+FL++-++Grea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55d13bb8cd86cdb29279f69393a89f79f6774095","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,209,59,184,205,134,205,178,146,121,246,147,147,168,159,121,246,119,64,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
