Vratyas Vakyas lived in Iceland for a considerable time, but now lives in DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼sseldorf, Germany again. Throughout the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lifetime, Falkenbach has progressed from a rawer, more ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œblackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sound towards viking-influenced folk metal with mainly clean vocals. VakyasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ music is nowdays accompanied by session musicians.\n\nTracklist:\n----------------\n1. Intro - 01:38\n2. ...Where His Ravens Fly... - 07:25\n3.
