Providing explanatory computer codes throughout the book, the author guides readers through many practical examples, such as:\n flow in isothermal and non-isothermal lid driven cavities;\n flow over obstacles;\n forced flow through a heated channel;\n conjugate forced convection; and\n natural convection.\n\n Diffusion and advection-diffusion equations are discussed with applications and examples, and complete computer codes accompany the coverage of single and multi-relaxation-time methods. Although the codes are written in FORTRAN, they can be easily translated to other languages, such as C++. The codes can also be extended with little effort to multi-phase and multi-physics, if the reader knows the physics of the problem.\n\n Readers with some experience of advanced mathematics and physics will find Lattice Boltzmann Method a useful and easy-to-follow text.
