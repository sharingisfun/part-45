It contains 24 tracks and 2 jingles recorded live at the BBC studios in London.\n\nWith the exception of the jingles being used to bookend the album, and the third track being\nmisplaced, The Who's recordings are presented here in chronological order.\n\nNOTE\n\nDue to publishing restrictions, the US version dropped 'Man With The Money' and edited out\nthe few lines from 'Spoonful' contained in 'Shakin' All Over'.\n\nReview by Richie Unterberger\n\nA fine compilation of 1965-73 BBC performances, the majority of the tracks hailing from 1965-\n67, although some are drawn from 1970 and 1973. As one of the best live bands ever, the\nWho as expected come through pretty well in the live-in-the-studio environment, although the\narrangements usually stick close to the records. Most of the songs were done by the group\nfor studio releases as well, but there are a few covers that they never put on their albums or\nsingles at the time, making this essential for the fan. Those numbers include the obscure\nJames Brown tune &quot;Just You and Me, Darling,&quot; &quot;Dancing in the Street,&quot; &quot;&quot;Good Lovin',&quot; and\n&quot;Leaving Here&quot; (although a mid-1960s studio version of that last song was eventually\nreleased). Of the other tracks, particularly worthwhile are &quot;Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere,&quot; with\nits extensive feedback solo, quite a challenge to do live in May 1965; &quot;The Good's Gone,&quot;\nwhich has a fuzz solo not on the studio version; and the 1970 performance of &quot;Shakin' All\nOver,&quot; which might be the best rendition of that concert staple that they ever did. This does\nnot have a few BBC songs that have shown up on bootlegs; particularly unfortunate\nexclusions are &quot;So Sad About Us,&quot; &quot;Summertime Blues,&quot; and their 1966 cover of the Everly\nBrothers' &quot;Man with Money.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n   1.
