Zappa was credited as conductor on the album cover and he described the contents as &quot;a curiously inconsistent piece, which started out to be a BALLET, but probably didn't make it.&quot; The album consists of pieces of Zappa's orchestral music interspersed with surreal spoken dialogues and linked with many odd sound effects and musical fragments. The title was inspired by an advertisement for Loma Linda Gravy Mix. In later years Zappa claimed Lumpy Gravy and Joe's Garage among his proudest achievements.\n\nMuch of Zappa's orchestral music was strongly influenced by his love of Igor Stravinsky ballets such as The Rite of Spring. Earlier in his career Zappa wrote music for a few independently produced Hollywood films, such as The World's Greatest Sinner (1962) and Run Home Slow (1965). Lumpy Gravy is closely related to these early soundtrack works. The juxtaposition of highbrow and lowbrow cultural influences was a radical idea at the time. It is also a defining characteristic of Zappa's entire musical output.\n\nIn 2008, the Lagunitas Brewing Company put out an American Strong Ale named after the album, featuring the cover art on the label. This is one in a series of beers planned to be released on the 40th anniversary of each of Zappa's studio albums.\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll tracks by Frank Zappa.\n\nSide one\n   1. &quot;Lumpy Gravy, Part One&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 15:48\n          * &quot;The Way I See It, Barry&quot;\n          * &quot;Duodenum&quot;\n          * &quot;Oh No&quot;\n          * &quot;Bit Of Nostalgia&quot;\n          * &quot;It's From Kansas&quot;\n          * &quot;Bored Out 90 Over&quot;\n          * &quot;Almost Chinese&quot;\n          * &quot;Switching Girls&quot;\n          * &quot;Oh No Again&quot;\n          * &quot;At the Gas Station&quot;\n          * &quot;Another Pickup&quot;\n          * &quot;I Don't Know If I Can Go Through This Again&quot;\n\nSide two\n   1. &quot;Lumpy Gravy, Part Two&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 15:51\n          * &quot;Very Distraughtening&quot;\n          * &quot;White Ugliness&quot;\n          * &quot;Amen&quot;\n          * &quot;Just One More Time&quot;\n          * &quot;A Vicious Circle&quot;\n          * &quot;King Kong&quot;\n          * &quot;Drums Are Too Noisy&quot;\n          * &quot;Kangaroos&quot;\n          * &quot;Envelops the Bath Tub&quot;\n          * &quot;Take Your Clothes Off&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e63f18e03f4ee9e6a094a7997153712b1facf409","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+Lumpy+Gravy+%281968%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e63f18e03f4ee9e6a094a7997153712b1facf409","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,63,24,224,63,78,233,230,160,148,167,153,113,83,113,43,31,172,244,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
