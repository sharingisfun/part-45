Nelson\nSource: BluRay\nVideo: 1920x1080 x264\nAudio: Track 1: English 5.1 Dolby Digital with Rifftrax in Center Channel\nTrack 2: English 5.1 Dolby Digital with Rifftrax in Left and Right Surround Channel\nTrack 3: English 5.1 Dolby Digital Original untouched\nSubtitles: Nope\n\nNote: This is a 5.1 Dolby Digital version with Rifftrax. I decoded the DTS soundtrack into 6 channels (2 Front, 2 Rear, 1 Center + Low Frequency Effects) and then mixed the Rifftrax-Track into the Left and Right Surround Channel. I then used a Dolby Digital Pro Encoder to create a AC3-Dolby Digital Surround Track to give you the impression to be in a movie theater and someone in the audience behind you is talking. I also mixed the Rifftrax track into the Center speaker (which is the default track), because the Center is mainly used for the spoken language track.\n\nIt started as a private experiment with surround sound mixing. Since it took me several hours to get the synch and (more or less) the volume mix right, I share it to save you the hassle. What do you think about this mix?\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/rifftrax/cocktail&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/rifftrax/cocktail&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like what Mike, Bill and Kevin are doing and you want them to be able to continue, please go to http://www.rifftrax.com and click on &quot;Donate&quot; to donate whatever you think is appropriate.
