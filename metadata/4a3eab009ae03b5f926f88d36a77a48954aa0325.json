CAN YOU INTRODUCE THIS TO THESE PEOPLE?\r\n\r\nANSWER:* The first thing -- perhaps they may not be aware of it -- is that the words &quot;medicine&quot; and &quot;meditation&quot; come from the same root. Their meaning is the same: to heal.\r\n...................\r\n\r\nQ:* YOU HAVE INVENTED SOME TECHNIQUES, MEDITATION TECHNIQUES, AND YOU SAY THAT IN INDIA THERE ARE A 112 TECHNIQUES OF MEDITATION. SO HOW TO CHOOSE WHAT IS USEFUL?\r\n..............................\r\n(Tape side C)\r\n\r\nQ:* WHILE YOU WERE SPEAKING, THIS IDEA CAME! YOU SAY PEOPLE HAVE TO BE HELPED TO BE AWAKENED, AND BASICALLY, I THINK, NONE OF THE PSYCHIATRIC OR MEDICAL TECHNIQUES ARE AWAKENING THE SELF. SO HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO CREATE MEDITATION COURSES IF SOMEBODY IS NOT AWAKENED TO LEAD THOSE MEDITATION COURSES?\r\n\r\nall text is in folder\r\nPlease, seed and share. free audio and books can be downloaded from oshoworld(dot)com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a3eab009ae03b5f926f88d36a77a48954aa0325","amp;dn":"Osho_The+Last+Testament_Vol-3+%2319_meditation-medication","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a3eab009ae03b5f926f88d36a77a48954aa0325","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,62,171,0,154,224,59,95,146,111,136,211,106,119,164,137,84,170,3,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
