Drastically outnumbered and pursued by the enemy's best, he must lead his men on a reckless march through northern Kez to safety, and back over the mountains so that he can defend his country from an angry god. In Adro, Inspector Adamat only wants to rescue his wife. To do so he must track down and confront the evil Lord Vetas. He has questions for Vetas concerning his enigmatic master, but the answers might come too quickly. With Tamas and his powder cabal presumed dead, Taniel Two-shot finds himself alongside the god-chef Mihali as the last line of defence against Kresimir's advancing army. Tamas's generals bicker among themselves, the brigades lose ground every day beneath the Kez onslaught, and Kresimir wants the head of the man who shot him in the eye.\n\n\nFormat: MP3\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1875c8c8e118cba22e2c032c6faa31ce15f2610","amp;dn":"Brian+McClellan+-+The+Crimson+Campaign+%28The+Powder+Mage+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1875c8c8e118cba22e2c032c6faa31ce15f2610","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,135,92,140,142,17,140,186,34,226,192,50,198,250,163,28,225,95,38,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
