The CD I purchased came with a 5.1 mix of the album which I found sounded MUCH better. I decided I would use this as the source for my digital copy.\n\n I thought that I would share my mix with others so they can enjoy a proper mix of the album like I have been.\n\nHow was it done?\n A direct stream copy of the 5.1 audio from the DVD in ac3 format. Conversion of this to 6-channel uncompressed .WAV files. Downmixing to stereo using a combination of programs (Avisynth did all the hard work) to 2-channel uncompressed .WAV files. The .WAV files were then compressed to MP3 using the newest version of LAME at the v0 variable bitrate preset and then tagged using MP3tag.\n\nProof\n I'll let the results speak for themselves. Below you'll find the output of the Dynamic Range Meter module for Foobar2000.\n\nFLAC rip direct from the CD\nDR Peak RMS Duration Track\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDR8 0.00 dB -8.75 dB 2:42 ?-False Awakening Suite\nDR5 0.00 dB -6.12 dB 6:17 ?-The Enemy inside\nDR6 0.00 dB -6.86 dB 4:53 ?-The Looking Glass\nDR6 0.00 dB -7.32 dB 6:02 ?-Enigma Machine\nDR6 0.00 dB -7.33 dB 7:41 ?-The Bigger Picture\nDR5 0.00 dB -6.94 dB 6:53 ?-Behind the Veil\nDR6 0.00 dB -7.33 dB 6:35 ?-Surrender to Reason\nDR6 0.00 dB -8.24 dB 4:45 ?-Along for the Ride\nDR6 0.00 dB -8.40 dB 22:18 ?-Illumination Theory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNumber of tracks: 9\nOfficial DR value: DR6\n\nSamplerate: 44100 Hz\nChannels: 2\nBits per sample: 16\nBitrate: 942 kbps\nCodec: FLAC\n================================================================================\n\nStereo downmix from the 5.1 surround\n\nDR Peak RMS Duration Track\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDR13 0.00 dB -14.29 dB 2:41 01-False Awakening Suite\nDR11 0.00 dB -11.96 dB 6:16 02-The Enemy Inside\nDR12 0.00 dB -13.79 dB 4:52 03-The Looking Glass\nDR11 0.00 dB -12.55 dB 6:01 04-Enigma Machine\nDR12 0.00 dB -13.38 dB 7:42 05-The Bigger Picture\nDR12 0.00 dB -13.62 dB 6:52 06-Behind the Veil\nDR13 0.00 dB -14.25 dB 6:33 07-Surrender to Reason\nDR12 0.00 dB -14.61 dB 4:43 08-Along for the Ride\nDR13 0.00 dB -15.78 dB 22:17 09-Illumination Theory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNumber of tracks: 9\nOfficial DR value: DR12\n\nSamplerate: 44100 Hz\nChannels: 2\nBitrate: 262 kbps\nCodec: MP3\n================================================================================\n\n\nIn many cases, the songs have nearly DOUBLE the dynamic range of their CD counterparts.\n\nDon't be a casualty of the loudness war. Download this version and enjoy the album the way it was meant to be enjoyed.\n\nAnd more importantly, BUY THE ALBUM AND SUPPORT THE ARTISTS.\n\n I also have a 5.1 AAC digital version direct from the DVD. It sounds amazing on a surround sound system (where as this stereo downmix was obviously designed for stereo systems). If you want this version then, well, you'll just have to buy the album.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42368f06bebd716d6512b6b00dd884ac882f65f1","amp;dn":"Dream+Theater+-+Dream+Theater+%282013%29+mp3+v0+%5BHD+Downmix+from+Sur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42368f06bebd716d6512b6b00dd884ac882f65f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,54,143,6,190,189,113,109,101,18,182,176,13,216,132,172,136,47,101,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
