His discography is relatively small, but this session cropped up in the mid-'90s and is of a relatively unknown origin, definitely live in concert, likely from Europe. There's a funny distant sound to the recording, Shorty's voice appears as though it has been processed through an echoplex, and although there's a horn section, it is not easily heard. Likely it's not an off the soundboard recording, and was originally in analog format. Four of these selections are extremely long; the title track, &quot;History of Jody,&quot; &quot;How Blue Can You Get?&quot; and &quot;Never Make Your Move Too Soon.&quot; Though known primarily as a more contemporary blues/R&amp;B or blues-rocker, Shorty shows a rootsier side on this collection, and while his vocal or guitar work is good enough to make this desirable for fans, it's not an essential purchase for the casual or staunch blues fan. \n\n\nTracklist\n1.
