The video was shot at a beach and a bowling alley in Los Angeles, which also co-stars Zac Efron. The official video uses a new mix of the song, which is slightly different from the album version. It is currently unknown whether or not this version will be released for purchase, but it will be the version sent to mainstream U.S. radio stations. This second video uses a version different from the song, slightly different from that of the album. It starts out with Hudgens walking inside the bowling alley and sees Efron getting shoes to bowl. It ends with both of them and their friends frolicking at the beach. The goal of this new video was the setting on sale on iTunes, and the version of the song of the clip was used for the diffusion out of radio. The official music video for &quot;Say OK&quot;, was first shown following the premiere of Disney&amp;#039;s Jump In!. The second version was directed by Darren Grant.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3db8e8966d575d35c6fa0f53a323b17740a8e516","amp;dn":"Vanessa+Hudgens+-+Say+Ok","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3db8e8966d575d35c6fa0f53a323b17740a8e516","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,184,232,150,109,87,93,53,198,250,15,83,163,35,177,119,64,168,229,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
