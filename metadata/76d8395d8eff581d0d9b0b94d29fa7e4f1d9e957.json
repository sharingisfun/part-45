The film was directed by Ida Lupino and stars Hayley Mills (in her first film after her contract with Walt Disney expired), Rosalind Russell and June Harding. The film's cast also includes Marge Redmond (who would play a nun in the television series The Flying Nun which premiered the following year) as math teacher Sister Liguori, Mary Wickes (who later on in her career played a nun in the movie Sister Act and its sequel Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit) as gym teacher Sister Clarissa, and Portia Nelson as art teacher Sister Elizabeth (who also played a nun in The Sound of Music).\n\n     CAST:-\n    THE NUNS:-\n    Rosalind Russell as the Mother Superior\n    Binnie Barnes as Sister Celestine\n    Camilla Sparv as Sister Constance\n    Hayley Mills as Mary Clancy\n    June Harding as Rachel Devery\n    Barbara Hunter as Marvel-Ann\n    Bernadette Withers as Valerie\n    Vicky Albright as Charlotte\n   \t\n    SUPPORTING CAST:-\n    Gypsy Rose Lee as Mrs. Phipps\n    Jim Boles as Mr. Gottschalk\n    Kent Smith as Uncle George\n    Pat McCaffrie as Mr. Devery\n    Harry Harvey, Sr. as Mr. Grisson\n    Mary Young as Mrs. Eldridge\n    Jim Hutton as Mr. Petrie (uncredited)\n\nDirected by Ida Lupino\nProduced by William Frye\nWritten by Jane Trahey (novel)\nMusic by Jerry Goldsmith\nRunning time 112 minutes\n\nMOVIE PLOT:- The Trouble With Angels (1966)\nThe movie is set at St. Francis Academy (also the name of the school in Sister Act 2), a fictional Catholic boarding school all-girls in Pennsylvania, operated by an order of nuns. Russell plays the Mother Superior, who spends the movie at odds with Mary Clancy (Hayley Mills), a rebellious teenager, and her misery-loves-company friend Rachel Devery (June Harding). The episodic storyline follows the young women through their sophomore, junior and senior high-school years. After spending much of the film resenting the authority of the Mother Superior, Mary receives the &quot;call&quot; senior year and, after graduation, remains at the school in the novitiate of the order.\n\nThe Trouble with Angels was based on the book, Life with Mother Superior by Jane Trahey about her own high-school years at a Catholic school near Chicago in the 1930s. While in the novel the school was portrayed as a boarding school outside the city, Trahey actually attended what is now Providence-St. Mel's High School, which was only a day school. Many of the incidents mentioned in the book were actually based on Trahey's experiences at Mundelein College in Chicago, Illinois. The character of Mary Clancy (Mills) was based on Jane's actual friend, Mary, who later became Sister John Eudes, a Sinsinawa Dominican nun.\nProduction\n\nThe Trouble with Angels was filmed from September to December 1965. The St. Francis Academy in the film was filmed on location at St. Mary's Home for Children in Ambler, Pennsylvania. All interior shots were filmed at Columbia Studios at Sunset &amp; Gower in Hollywood. The film was budgeted at $2 million.\n\nMOVIE IMPACT:-\nThe film marked a departure for Mills, who was attempting to emerge from her juvenile leads in Walt Disney-produced teen comedies as a comedic actress.\nThe Trouble with Angels enjoyed good reviews and enough success to warrant a sequel (Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows). However, Mills opted not to reprise her role as the progressive protagonist and was replaced by Stella Stevens, who played Sister George, foil to Rosalind RussellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mother Superior. Variety magazine said &quot;An appealing story idea...hip Mother Superior nun who outfoxes and matures two rebellious students in a Catholic girls' school...has lost impact via repetitious plotting and pacing, plus routine direction&quot;.\n\nBurlesque performer Gypsy Rose Lee appears in a small role. Previously, Rosalind Russell played Lee's mother in the 1962 film Gypsy.\nAn uncredited Jim Hutton appears briefly as the principal of a competing school.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 3994 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 112 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76d8395d8eff581d0d9b0b94d29fa7e4f1d9e957","amp;dn":"The+Trouble+With+Angels+%281966%29+DVD5+-+Rosalind+Russell%2C+Hayley+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76d8395d8eff581d0d9b0b94d29fa7e4f1d9e957","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,216,57,93,142,255,88,29,13,155,11,148,210,159,167,228,241,217,233,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
