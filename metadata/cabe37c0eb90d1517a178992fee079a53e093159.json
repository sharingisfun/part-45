To save his people from banishment, he sold himself to the evil Morgana. Finally free, he faces a new challenge: Jaelyn, an elite vampire warrior sent to capture him. By rights, he should kill her on sight. Yet he cannot bring himself to hurt her--or to resist her. . .\nJaelyn is stunningly beautiful, utterly lethal--and always alone. Until Ariyal. From their first encounter, she knows that what's between them is more dangerous than simple lust. And as they unite to thwart a terrifying prophecy that will mean the end of his clan and of the world they know, she will risk everything to fulfill her destiny by his side. . .\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cabe37c0eb90d1517a178992fee079a53e093159","amp;dn":"Bound+By+Darkness+-+Alexandra+Ivy%2C+Epub%2C+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cabe37c0eb90d1517a178992fee079a53e093159","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,190,55,192,235,144,209,81,122,23,137,146,254,224,121,165,62,9,49,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
