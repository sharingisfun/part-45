A week later, the town is overrun and its communication lines cut. With all the honest men fighting the Civil War, the desperate mining investors put together a collection of outlaws, killers and thieves to re-take Brimstone ... by any means necessary. Led by 'The Viper,' a brooding gunslinger whose brutal exploits are the stuff of Western legend, the vicious posse finds the bullet-ridden town littered with dismembered corpses but its gold stores untouched. In Brimstone, the most feared men in the West have finally found the very heart of fear.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71b3c3c50d61103e96ae98dcf48cf232874a44f7","amp;dn":"Brimstone+Vol.+1+%282011%29+%28Digital%29+%28JK-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71b3c3c50d61103e96ae98dcf48cf232874a44f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,179,195,197,13,97,16,62,150,174,152,220,244,140,242,50,135,74,68,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
