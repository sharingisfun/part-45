I believe this is the testimony of scripture of genuine salvation and saving faith. AMEN\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlleged Bible Contradictions Concerning Salvation--Audio:\nby Jeff Miller, Ph.D.\nConfusion and disagreement exist within Christendom concerning salvation. For exmple, some believe baptism is not necessary for one to receive salvation, while others argue that baptism is essential. Both cannot be right. In the midst of the confusion, the skeptic gains support for his proposition that the Bible must contain contradictions, since both &quot;sides&quot; believe their view is supported by the Bible. Does the Bible contain contradictions regarding salvation? Are there requirements for our salvation?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIs Once Saved Always Saved True?\nAre you saved or deceived? This compelling series of video clips will help you examine yourself and your salvation from a true biblical perspective.

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal.
