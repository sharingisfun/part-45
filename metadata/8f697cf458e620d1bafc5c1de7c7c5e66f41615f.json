In The War of Ideas, he revealed the conflict of ideologies that underlie the War on Terror. Now, in The Confrontation, he identifies the clashes to come and provides a blueprint for defeating the forces of jihad.\n\nMoving from the ravaged villages of the Sudan to London's Muslim neighborhoods to the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, he illuminates the vast and complex world of the global jihadist movement. He offers a multi-pronged strategy, global in scope, and calls on the world's diverse local and international institutions to come together and coordinate their efforts. Pointing the way forward, this book shows how we might reclaim a world that is safe for freedom and democratic societies.\n\nAuthor: Walid Phares\nPublisher: Center for Security Policy\nPublication Date: September 22, 2010\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f697cf458e620d1bafc5c1de7c7c5e66f41615f","amp;dn":"Walid+Phares+-+The+Confrontation+%5BAgainst+Jihad%5D+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f697cf458e620d1bafc5c1de7c7c5e66f41615f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,105,124,244,88,230,32,209,186,252,92,29,231,199,197,230,111,65,97,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
