So for the completists and\nthe fans: here is another excellent Fred Anderson album, recorded live on\nNov. 17, 2007 in PoznaÃ…â€ž, Poland, at the Made In Chicago festival, and just\nreleased on the Polish label Estrada PoznaÃ…â€žska, and we can only thank them for\nthat. Anderson is accompanied by Harrison Bankhead on bass, and Dushun Mosley\non drums. There are no real surprises, apart from the fact that the album\nbrings no less than seven tracks, ranging between nine to sixteen minutes long,\nso you get a lot of music, played in his typical free bop style full of\nrhythmical and lyrical soloing, once in a while interspersed with some slower\nspiritual moments. You can not but admire the man. His love of music is truly\ncontagious. Impossible to listen to this without enjoying it too!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9e21bd4e47d900a6a7e521300417133350a105a","amp;dn":"Fred+Anderson+Trio+-+A+Night+At+The+Velvet+Lounge.+Made+In+Chica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9e21bd4e47d900a6a7e521300417133350a105a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,226,27,212,228,125,144,10,106,126,82,19,0,65,113,51,53,10,16,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
