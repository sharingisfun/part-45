Ezekiel Emanuel is really good at playing the type of combat interviews that Fox News specializes inÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ except that instead of yelling lies, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s yelling the truth. Who knew that shouting the truth on Fox News would work? I always assumed that they used microphones that were unable to pick up any sound that included a factual statement.\n\nEmanuel defended the Obamacare rules with the example that you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t buy a car that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a seatbelt or airbags. Yes, but conservatives also want to also do away with consumer safety rules. So give them points for consistency on that one. The health plans that are getting dropped are so crappy that if they were cars they would be cars without seatbelts, airbags, or driverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s side doors. Oh, and the gas tank would be made of Styrofoam.\n\nMeanwhile, Mitt Romney is attacking President Obama for Ã¢â‚¬Å“dishonesty.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Is Mitt Romney so entrenched in his made-up world that he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t realize that he is the poster boy for dishonesty for the people in the real world? Mitt said that President ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s statements about Obamacare have demonstrated Ã¢â‚¬Å“fundamental dishonesty.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This, from the guy who tried to deny that he even had anything to do with Romneycare! Mitt continuously tried to deny he had anything to do with Romneycare when he was governor of Massachusetts. Hell, he tried to deny that he had anything to do with Massachusetts! Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fundamental dishonesty!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mitt could teach graduate-level courses on the fundamentals of dishonesty!\n\nThe statements of Mitt Romney are perhaps the most fact-checked statements in the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€and they have yet to find a single fact. Mitt has more Ã¢â‚¬Å“pants on fireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ episodes than a major conflagration at the LeviÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s factory. Fact-checking him is almost pointless. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like testing a worm for worms.\n\nFinally, it turns out that the suspect in the shooting at LAX had Ã¢â‚¬Å“patriot movementÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ literature with him. The only surprising thing is that it was printed material. Those people never struck me as big readers. Sources say the suspect had a Ã¢â‚¬Å“manifestoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ associated with the patriot movement. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a little advice for everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â€if your reading material is confined to manifestos, you might want to start checking out some other reading... like light fiction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7981a4110e8be17864d1979542bb31fb797b9555","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+November+04+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7981a4110e8be17864d1979542bb31fb797b9555","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,129,164,17,14,139,225,120,100,209,151,149,66,187,49,251,121,123,149,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
