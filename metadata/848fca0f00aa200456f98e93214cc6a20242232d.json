Today, instead of looking at the human body as a biological machine, many people believe it is a vast energetic network, where spirit, matter, and power intersect. On  Energy Anatomy (review or buy), Caroline Myss helps the listener learn to view his/her health through a spiritual/biological lens to offer a new picture of how the human body heals.
