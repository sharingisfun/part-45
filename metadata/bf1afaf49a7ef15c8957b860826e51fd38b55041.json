It examines the perception of this complex, multifaceted motif within the overall intellectual and visual universe of the medieval Irano-Turkish world. Using a broadly comparative approach, the author explores the ever-shifting semantics of the dragon motif as it emerges in neighbouring Muslim and non-Muslim cultures. The book will be of particular interest to those concerned with the relationship between the pre-Islamic, Islamic and Eastern Christian (especially Armenian) world. The study is fully illustrated, with 209 (b/w and full colour) plates, many of previously unpublished material. Illustrations include photographs of architectural structures visited by the author, as well as a vast collection of artefacts, all of which are described and discussed in detail with inscription readings, historical data and textual sources","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf1afaf49a7ef15c8957b860826e51fd38b55041","amp;dn":"The+Dragon+in+Medieval+East+Christian+and+Islamic+Art.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf1afaf49a7ef15c8957b860826e51fd38b55041","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,26,250,244,154,126,241,92,137,87,184,96,130,110,81,253,56,181,80,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
