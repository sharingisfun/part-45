In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nAND THEY'RE OFF!\n\nFriday at 9PM ET on FBN\n\nWho will be the next president? Here's our show:\n\nLIBERTY ON THE BALLOT: We libertarians believe: &quot;government that governs best--governs least&quot;. So what does this election mean for liberty? Matt Welch of Reason rates the candidates.\n\nPREDICTION MARKETS: Pollsters and pundits claim they know who will win, but they have been so wrong often. Prediction markets have a much better track record because people put their money where their mouth is. Our repressive government has banned most American prediction markets, saying they're &quot;contrary to the public interest.&quot; Nonsense. At least foreign predictions markets still exist. Betfair, based in Britain, gives these odds on our Presidential election:\n\nGOP PRIMARY\n\nBush 31.59%\n\nWalker 18.09%\n\nRubio 17.62%\n\nPaul 7.80%\n\nCruz 4.77%\n\nHuckabee3.75%\n\nPerry 1.72%\n\nPence 1.13%\n\nChristie 1.05%\n\nSantorum 0.50%\n\nDEMOCRATIC PRIMARY\n\nClinton 78.82%\n\nWarren 6.34%\n\nWORLD'S SMALLEST POLITICAL QUIZ: Advocates for Self-Government scored each candidate on a political quiz that shows where they fall on this graph. The results are surprising.\n\n\n\nYou can take the quiz here to see where you fall.\n\nFAITH IN POLITICS: All today's presidential candidates say they believe in God. But some make a bigger deal of it than others. Stossel looks at candidates who want to limit freedom for the sake of their religious values. Huckabee and Santorum want government to ban same sex marriage and abortion.\n\nTEA PARTY: Fox contributor Monica Crowley says, because of the Tea Party, Republicans now fight harder for smaller government. Candidates considered &quot;Tea Party candidates&quot; are Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Rick Perry. They sure talk a good game...\n\nGOVERNORS: Former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson ran for president as a libertarian in 2012 and got 1.3 million votes. Stossel says he would have been a good president. Johnson rates four current governors who want to be President: Scott Walker of Wisconsin, John Kasich of Ohio, Chris Christie of New Jersey, and Mike Pence of Indiana.\n\nFriday at 9PM ET on Fox Business Network\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            :Stossel.2015.04.24.And.Theyre.Off.WS.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 339 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 9s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 150 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 9s\nBit rate                                 : 1 012 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 1 297 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 23.379 fps\nOriginal frame rate                      : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 4.281 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.197\nStream size                              : 298 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1297 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 9s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.7 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a3a58ed5bd056f1fbc1877cc4931b413d25b574","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.04.24.And.Theyre.Off.WS.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a3a58ed5bd056f1fbc1877cc4931b413d25b574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,58,88,237,91,208,86,241,251,193,135,124,196,147,27,65,61,37,181,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
