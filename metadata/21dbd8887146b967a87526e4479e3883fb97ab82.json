With the addition of a section on modern, synthetic rope in the 1970s, its popularity has continued undiminished to this day. It teaches a few basic knots--the bowline, sheet bend, and rolling hitch, among others--and splices in three-strand and braided rope. But its real business is decorative rope and canvaswork--the traditional arts of the sailor--and here it has no equal. For a rope mat, a rope ladder, a sea chest, a ditty bag, a canvas bucket, a mast boot, and the best-looking rope fenders or heaving line in the marina, this is the book of choice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21dbd8887146b967a87526e4479e3883fb97ab82","amp;dn":"The+Marlinspike+Sailor+%28Hervey+Garret+Smith%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21dbd8887146b967a87526e4479e3883fb97ab82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,219,216,136,113,70,185,103,168,117,38,228,71,158,56,131,251,151,171,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
