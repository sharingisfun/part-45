Soooooo....\r\n\r\nPlease seed this if you enjoy it, as of today this is the first torrent of this I know of after scouring the internet. I will seed as long as I can from my laptop.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:448b7100ce3c08d9ff2bfc8b545b798cfddcf455","amp;dn":"The+Other+One%3A+The+Long+Strange+Trip+of+Bob+Weir+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"448b7100ce3c08d9ff2bfc8b545b798cfddcf455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,139,113,0,206,60,8,217,255,43,252,139,84,91,121,140,253,220,244,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
