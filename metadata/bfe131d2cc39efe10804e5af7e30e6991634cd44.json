It can be run directly from a CD/DVD/USBStick and optionally be installed to a HDD, including IDE, SCSI, SATA, PATA and USB drives.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Dreamlinux comes with a selection of the best applications designed to meet most of your daily needs.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Dreamlinux is based on the venerable Debian Operating System. This means it takes advantage of Debian's best features and adds its own modern development tools, system scripts and applications.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Dreamlinux Desktop Edition 3.5 comes with XFCE Desktop Environment as default. However, nothing prevents anyone from using other desktop environments, thanks to Dreamlinux's modular architecture. For example, you'll find Gnome Desktop Environment available as an XFCE replacement. Shortly, we will make LXDE, TDE and Fluxbox available as well.\n\nMultimedia resources\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Dreamlinux comes with all the codecs and media players needed for a good multimedia experience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfe131d2cc39efe10804e5af7e30e6991634cd44","amp;dn":"Dreamlinux+Desktop+Edition+3.5+XFCE+CD+iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfe131d2cc39efe10804e5af7e30e6991634cd44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,225,49,210,204,57,239,225,8,4,229,175,126,48,230,153,22,52,205,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
