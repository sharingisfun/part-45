Black is especially quick to avenge any slight against his dim-witted pal. The result? The citizens of Treasure Town are afraid of them, the police are afraid of them--even the local yakuza gangsters are afraid of them! But when the crime boss known as the &quot;Rat&quot; returns to Treasure Town, it looks like there's gonna be a rumble... \nThe violence in this unique European-influenced manga title is more mindful than it seems at first glance, and the subtle relationships between its unique cast of characters are marked by surprising poignancy.\n\nAlso available as an animated movie","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c1eb97e0eac71605aace8534c6f1644064ddc49","amp;dn":"Taiyo+Matsumoto%3A+Tekkon+Kinkreet+-+Black+%26amp%3B+White+%28Viz%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c1eb97e0eac71605aace8534c6f1644064ddc49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,30,185,126,14,172,113,96,90,172,232,83,76,111,22,68,6,77,220,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
