Before he knew it, he had recorded a whole album's worth of music. But this time around Dempsey was hesitant to apply his own voice and lyrics and instead enlisted the help of various local luminaries from Australian bands to sing on the tracks.\n\nThe resulting album released under the name 'Scared of Horses', and titled An Empty Flight was a beautiful collection of songs which, set to Dempsey's one-man- band compositions showed his unique musical diversity along with the talents of some of Australia's most innovative vocalists.\n\n'An Empty Flight' features the lyrical and vocal talents of Glenn RIchards (Augie March), Jamie Hutchings (Bluebottle Kiss), Heinz Reigler (Not From There), Andrea Prudente (Arrosa), Dik (S:Bahn), Stephanie Ashworth (Sandpit, Something for Kate) and Laura Macfarlane (Ninety-nine).\n\nAfter selling out its initial pressing in a flash, An Empty Flight  has been near impossible to find ever since and subsequently became a rare and highly collectible. Finally we now have the great pleasure of making it available via iTunes on September 3rd.\n\nFORMAT:         MPEG-1, Layer 3 (.mp3)\nBIT RATE:       256 kbps\nSAMPLE RATE:    44.100 kHz\nCHANNELS:       Joint Stereo\nID3 TAG:        v2.3\nENCODED WITH:   LAME 3.99\n\n0.
