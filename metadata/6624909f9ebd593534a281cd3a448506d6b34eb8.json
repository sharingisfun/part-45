The year was 1976 It was the Bicentenial year and Jimmy Carter was the President. Bill Gates was still workin out of his garage in the soon to be Sillicon Valley and Black Sabbath and Blue Oyster Cult were on the Black and Blue Tour. Well thats enough history, this is one of my all time favorites and now Im sharing it with you I must have bought this album at least 20 times over the years first on LP then cassettes and finally on CD. Now finally full circle hope you enjoy this as much as I have Maybe some of ya will seed this ....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6624909f9ebd593534a281cd3a448506d6b34eb8","amp;dn":"Rush+2112+320kbps+mp3+CDrip+ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6624909f9ebd593534a281cd3a448506d6b34eb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,36,144,159,158,189,89,53,52,162,129,205,58,68,133,6,214,179,78,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
