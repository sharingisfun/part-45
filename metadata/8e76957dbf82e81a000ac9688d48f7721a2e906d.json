Pitched past pitch of grief,\nMore pangs will, schooled at forepangs, wilder wring.\nComforter, where, where is your comforting?\nMary, mother of us, where is your relief?\nMy cries heave, herds-long; huddle in a main, a chief-\nwoe, world-sorrow; on an age-old anvil wince and sing Ã¢â‚¬â€\nThen lull, then leave off. Fury had shrieked 'No ling-\nering! Let me be fell: force I must be brief'.\nO the mind, mind has mountains; cliffs of fall\nFrightful, sheer, no-man-fathomed. Hold them cheap\nMay who ne'er hung there. Nor does long our small\nDurance deal with that steep or deep. Here! creep,\nWretch, under a comfort serves in a whirlwind: all\nLife death does end and each day dies with sleep.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nHopkins seemingly odd English (which he termed 'Sprung Verse') is the nineteenth century version of the equally odd English of seventeenth century metaphysical poetry. Both have their origin in the intense spiritual wrestling between word and meaning.\n\nThis is the (rare) late sixties Argo LP with Michael Redgrave, Barbara Jefford, Richard Pasco and George Rylands. Again, copybook readings of English verse which can be warmly recommended.
