The movie was adapted by Walter DeLeon from the play The \n\nGhost Breaker by Paul Dickey and Charles W. Goddard, no relation to Paulette.\n\nAlong with Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein and Hope's own The Cat and the Canary, it is cited as a prime example of the classic Hollywood horror-comedy.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Bob Hope as Larry Lawrence\n    Paulette Goddard as Mary Carter\n    Richard Carlson as Geoff Montgomery\n    Paul Lukas as Parada\n    Willie Best as Alex\n    Pedro de Cordoba as Havez (as Pedro De Cordoba)\n    Virginia Brissac as Mother Zombie\n    Noble Johnson as The Zombie\n    Anthony Quinn as Ramon Mederes/Francisco Mederes\n    Tom Dugan as Raspy Kelly\n    Paul Fix as Frenchy Duval\n    Lloyd Corrigan as Martin\n\nDirected by George Marshall\nProduced by Arthur Hornblow, Jr.\nWritten by Walter DeLeon\nMusic by Ernst Toch\nRunning time 83 min.\n\nOTHER VERSIONS OF 'THE GHOST BREAKERS&quot;\nThe Dickey and Goddard play The Ghost Breaker was filmed twice previously by Paramount, first in 1914 by Cecil B. DeMille, with stars H. B. Warner and Rita Stanwood. \nIt was filmed again in 1922 by director Alfred E. Green, starring Wallace Reid and Lila Lee. Both these silent film versions are now considered to be lost films.\n\nGeorge Marshall, director of the 1940 version, remade The Ghost Breakers as Scared Stiff (1953), featuring Martin and Lewis (Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis). \nThe remake featured cameos not only from Hope, but also from Bing Crosby. A year before Scared Stiff, Martin and Lewis appeared in the Crosby/Hope film Road to Bali.\n\nThe film was adapted for radio on Screen Directors Playhouse on April 4, 1949 with Bob Hope re-creating his film role and Shirley Mitchell as Mary. Hope appeared again on the program for an hour-long version on June 14, 1951.\n\n\nSYNOPSIS:- The Ghost Breakers (1940)\nThe film opens in a Manhattan radio studio during a broadcast by crime reporter Lawrence Lawrence (Bob Hope)Ã¢â‚¬â€&quot;Larry&quot; to his friends, as well as his enemies, who are many in number among the local underworld.\n\nListening in on the broadcast is pretty brunette Mary Carter (Paulette Goddard), whose high-rise hotel room goes dark as a violent thunderstorm causes a city-wide blackout. In the near darkness, a knock comes at her door. It is Mr. Parada (Paul Lukas), a suave, vaguely sinister Cuban solicitor. He delivers the deed to her inherited plantation and mansion, &quot;Castillo Maldito,&quot; on a small island off the coast of Cuba. Despite Parada's discouragement, she impulsively decides to travel to Cuba by ship to inspect her new property.\n\nDuring Parada's visit, Mary receives a telephone call from Mr. Mederes (Anthony Quinn), an even more sinister gent who warns Mary not to sell the newly inherited property to Parada. \n\nMary agrees to meet Mederes later.\n\nMeanwhile, after Larry Lawrence has finished broadcasting the evening's exposÃƒÂ© of a local crime boss, he receives a telephone call from the crime boss, Frenchy Duval (Paul Fix). \n\nFrenchy invites Larry to his hotel to discuss the broadcast so he can &quot;give it&quot; to him straight.\n\nCoincidentally, Frenchy is living in the same hotel where Mary Carter lives. Mederes arrives on the same hotel floor as Larry. However, Mederes is looking for Parada. Mederes confronts Parada and Parada shoots and kills him. Larry hears the shot and fires his gun at random. In a mix-up in the still-darkened building, Larry sees the body and believes he's killed one of Duval's henchmen. In the confusion he finds himself in the rooms of Mary Carter, who is already busy packing for her journey. Believing that he is being pursued by Duval's men, Larry hides in Mary's large open trunk. Unaware of Larry's presence, Mary locks the trunk and arranges for its transport to the harbor.\n\nLater at the dock, Larry's valet Alex (Willie Best) searches among the luggage bound for loading and finds Larry among them. Although not in time to prevent the trunk's transfer to the ship's hold, Alex manages to get on board, hoping to extricate his employer before the ship sails.\n\nOnce in her stateroom, Mary is surprised to unpack Larry along with the rest of her belongings. Larry and Alex decide to remain on board, partly to act as bodyguards to the plucky beauty, but also to keep out of reach of Frenchy Duval and the police.\n\nAs Larry and Mary strike up a flirtation, they run into an acquaintance of Mary's, Geoff Montgomery (Richard Carlson), a young professorial type who regales them with tales of the local superstitions of their destination, particularly voodoo, ghosts and zombies.\n\nUpon reaching port in Havana, Mary, Larry, Alex go to the island. En route they find a shack occupied by an old woman (Virginia Brissac) and her catatonic son (Noble Johnson), whom they believe is a zombie. The imposing plantation manor proves to be a spooky edifice indeed. They begin to explore the long-abandoned, cobweb-ridden mansion, and discover a large portrait of a woman who is nearly an exact likeness of MaryÃ¢â‚¬â€most certainly an ancestor.\n\nSoon they are terrorized by the appearance of a ghost, and the reappearance of the zombie. Are these real, or are they a ruse to frighten Mary away from her inheritance?\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 83 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 83 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55173cd27736dc32ed66f9098d2211e6f0f3150e","amp;dn":"Bob+Hope+Collection+-+The+Ghost+Breakers+%281940%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Paule","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55173cd27736dc32ed66f9098d2211e6f0f3150e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,23,60,210,119,54,220,50,237,102,249,9,141,34,17,230,240,243,21,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
