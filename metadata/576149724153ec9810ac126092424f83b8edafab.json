The film tells the story of this man's astonishing genius, his visions and inventions. Tesla's own scientific and autobiographical writings, as well as archival photographs and re-enactments are used to tell the story. A native of Austro-Hungary, Tesla came to America in 1884. Working first with Edison, the two inventors fell out over Edison's insistence on using direct current. Tesla took his alternating current vision to Westinghouse. His New York address was renowned for the bolts of lightning emanating from it, as Tesla worked to unlock the secrets of energy and electricity. His quest took him to Colorado. The film follows Tesla's exploits and eccentricities, which made him a darling of the press. Included is the well-known and touching story of his devotion to a certain white pigeon. Largely forgotten today in spite of the great debt the modern world owes him, the film pays tribute to this overlooked genius.\n\nVideo Information\n------------------------------\nResolution: 512x368\nBitrate: 1000 kbs\nFrames per second: 23.976\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/dAakcAagi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/dAakcAagi&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:576149724153ec9810ac126092424f83b8edafab","amp;dn":"Tesla%3A+Master+of+Lightning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"576149724153ec9810ac126092424f83b8edafab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,97,73,114,65,83,236,152,16,172,18,96,146,66,79,131,184,237,175,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
