He was Switzerland&amp;#039;s first great race car driver despite the fact he could never compete in his home country because Switzerland banned auto racing in 1955 after the LeMans tragedy. Despite this, Siffert started out racing motorcycles before progressing to race cars. He raced in several sports car events before moving to the Formula 1 World Championship in 1962. He was a popular performer, known for his daring-yet controlled driving on the track and his quiet demeanor off it. Siffert won two grand prix races and drove until 1971, when he was killed during a non-championship Formula 1 race, ironically only a few months after his last victory.\n\nWon two Formula 1 races, two pole positions and had four fastest laps.\n\nSwiss race car driver.\n\nCompeted in 96 Formula 1 World Championship races.\n\nOriginal Language. No subtitles.\n\n1hr 25min\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dd5dff42d97a3dfe2b7fb1732ca02f60885fd86","amp;dn":"Jo.Siffert.Live.Fast.Die.Young-Biography+of+Jo+Siffert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dd5dff42d97a3dfe2b7fb1732ca02f60885fd86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,213,223,244,45,151,163,223,226,183,251,23,50,202,2,246,8,133,253,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
