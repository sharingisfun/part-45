From a house  in\nthe city, journey to a series of worlds and  solve\npuzzles to rescue an abducted  princess.  In  each\nworld, you have a different power  to  affect  the\nway time behaves, and  it  is  time's  strangeness\nthat  creates  the  puzzles.  The  time  behaviors\ninclude: the ability to rewind, objects  that  are\nimmune to being rewound,  time  that  is  tied  to\nspace,  parallel  realities,  time  dilation,  and\nperhaps more. Braid treats your time and attention\nas precious there is  no  filler  in  this  game.\nEvery  puzzle  shows  you  something  new  and\ninteresting about the game world.\n\n1- Unpack, burn or mount\n2- Install game\n3- Go To Hell","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f59953da745879b5b4c4de5848bb6774d6501de3","amp;dn":"Braid.RETAIL-PROPHET","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f59953da745879b5b4c4de5848bb6774d6501de3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,153,83,218,116,88,121,181,180,196,222,88,72,187,103,116,214,80,29,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
