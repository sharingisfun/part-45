A curse is put on the Dracula family reducing them to mortal Breathers unless three screams are heard. Ingrid goes round to the Branagh house to babysit Robin's brothers but screams when she asks them who the most beautiful girl in the school is. The Count then screams when Vlad accidentally throws garlic into the same room as him. Finally Vlad screams when trying to protect Robin from Eric Van Helsing when he tries to stake them.\n\n\nFrom 2006\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:657f7cbaf911b6499e0f92d2171686149e90823d","amp;dn":"Halloween.TV-Young.Dracula.S01E12.Halloscream.DSR.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"657f7cbaf911b6499e0f92d2171686149e90823d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,127,124,186,249,17,182,73,158,15,146,210,23,22,134,20,158,144,130,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
