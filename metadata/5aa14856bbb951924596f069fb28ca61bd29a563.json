Recorded in late 1969 but not released until 1974, Spaces features Coryell surrounding himself with some top talent: John McLaughlin, Billy Cobham (both later of Mahavishnu Orchestra) and Miroslav Vitous (later of Weather Report). Chick Corea joins the group on electric piano for one track, &quot;Chris.&quot;\nTruth be told, this sounds more like jazz than jazz-rock. Only the great title track has rock rhythms; the rest of it is &quot;rock&quot; mostly by virtue of the electric guitars (which nevertheless are set to a minimal amount of distortion). It's difficult for me to discern which guitarist is playing at any particular time, although the liner notes indicate that Coryell does the majority of the soloing. Miroslav Vitous was an excellent choice of bassist for this kind of music and he demonstrates his versatility by playing with a bow on some passages. &quot;Chris,&quot; on which Chick Corea sits in, is another hightlight. Corea's electric piano is primarily used for atmosphere while Coryell and McLaughlin engage in some of their most diverse playing on the record, drawing on a wealth of influences in their quick-picked passages. &quot;Renee's Theme,&quot; a tribute to jazz guitar legend Django Reinhardt, is consistently cited by fans of the album as a favorite. Somewhat different in character from the rest of the pieces, it's a fleet-fingered acoustic guitar duet with head-turning speed and precision.
