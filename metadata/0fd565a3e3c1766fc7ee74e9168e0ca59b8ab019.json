Beauty Day is a rambunctious documentary about this irrepressible pioneer of local-access cable shenanigans who entertained and outraged viewers in the small city of St. Catharines-until a special Easter Show, featuring a fat rabbit and adorable puppies (none of which were hurt), got him kicked off the air for good. With a nod to Werner Herzog, Cheel follows the life and times of Cap'n Video and finds that the Cap'n is still quite a firecracker.\n\n\nIf you like this movie, please support the authors and buy the dvd.\n\nShow your appreciation by leaving a comment and don't forget to seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fd565a3e3c1766fc7ee74e9168e0ca59b8ab019","amp;dn":"Beauty+Day+2011+Documentary+DVDRip+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fd565a3e3c1766fc7ee74e9168e0ca59b8ab019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,213,101,163,227,193,118,111,199,238,116,233,22,142,12,165,155,138,176,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
