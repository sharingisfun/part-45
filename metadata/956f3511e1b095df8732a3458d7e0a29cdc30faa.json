Then Jay, without fighting, resolves the conflict. The girl introduces herself as Manasa (Richa Gangopadhyay). They slowly become friends. But one day she asks Jay to leave her and go as she cannot stand the separation from him if their relationship develops any further. He then goes back to India and with his friend's help reaches Manasa's village. There, where everyone are conservative in nature, he changes their nature and makes them more lovable.\nWhen Manasa expresses her love for him , he tells his flashback. It is then revealed that he was born to their rival's family. His father wanted to convert the people of his village. But his mother didn't want to stay there , so she left him. Later when Jay goes there, he falls in love with Vennela (Anushka Shetty).\nHe starts taking revenge on the other family without revealing his identity. Then they decide to marry Jay with Vennela because they both are in love with each other. During the marriage the inspector tells his father that the enmity is rekindling because his son is taking revenge on the rivals. Soon afterwards, the rivals come and start killing everyone. After the fight it is known that Jay's mother dies. His father banishes him and blames her death on him. The story is now back to the present. Manasa's father challenges Jay that if he can defeat his men then he too would follow non violence. After successfully defeating them, her father asks Jay that if he could defeat the rival's son ( not knowing that it was Jay himself) he would marry Manasa to Jay.\nJay gets angry at his stubbornness and reveals his true identity. He starts beating him up. Then all her family members come and convert him too. This was watched by his father who had just arrived there. His father welcomes him back to the family. The film ends with him reuniting with Vennela.\n\nGeneral\nUnique ID                                : 187197368956931068803358467623806294869 (0x8CD4E6DEE2BD5E6BB3392E3DA89FDB55)\nComplete name                            : D:New folderMirchi (2013) Telugu - BRRIP - x264 - 720p - AC3 - PAVANMirchi (2013) Telugu - BRRIP - x264 - 720p - AC3 - PAVAN.mkv\n\nFormat                                   : Matroska\nFormat version                           : Version 2\nFile size                                : 1.17 GiB\nDuration                                 : 2h 40mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 044 Kbps\nEncoded date                             : UTC 2013-05-24 15:09:47\nWriting application                      : mkvmerge v6.1.0 ('Old Devil') built on Mar  2 2013 14:32:37\nWriting library                          : libebml v1.3.0 + libmatroska v1.4.0\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c48cada3ac8488f7eaf5&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                                 : 2h 40mn\nBit rate                                 : 914 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 544 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 2.35:1\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 24.000 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.055\nStream size                              : 1.00 GiB (86%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 130 r2273 b3065e6\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\nLanguage                                 : English\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nCodec ID                                 : A_AC3\nDuration                                 : 2h 40mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 147 MiB (12%)\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:956f3511e1b095df8732a3458d7e0a29cdc30faa","amp;dn":"Mirchi+%282013%29+Telugu+-+BRRIP+-+x264+-+720p+-+AC3+-+PAVAN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"956f3511e1b095df8732a3458d7e0a29cdc30faa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,111,53,17,225,176,149,223,135,50,163,69,141,126,10,41,205,195,15,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
