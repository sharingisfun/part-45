I needed to do some serious time stretching, but it came out great for what it is. For those that don't know, the voice of the teacher is that of one Mrs. Fagan who was actually one of Vai's teachers when he was a kid, in Carle Place! heh Classic! As a kid, I knew I had to learn to jam out as best I could when I first saw this.\n\n\nFile is compatible with XBOX360, PS3, etc...\n\nSpecs and screenshots: http://i1242.photobucket.com/albums/gg521/hm20128lk/SteveVai-TheAudienceIsListeningm2ts_tn.jpg                        \n\nFile name: Steve Vai-The Audience Is Listening.m2ts\n\nFile size: 29.33 MB\n\nDuration: 5:54.016\n\nVideo: MPEG-4 AVC x.264 512x384p 25.026 fps 4:3\n\nAudio: DD2.0 AC3 192 Kbps @ 44.1 KHz (CD Audio source)\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and please seed!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ab8c1f557aa7cffb2f7e7dadbefedef50d6af0a","amp;dn":"Steve+Vai+-+The+Audience+Is+Listening+384p+CDAudio+source","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ab8c1f557aa7cffb2f7e7dadbefedef50d6af0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,184,193,245,87,170,124,255,178,247,231,218,219,239,237,239,80,214,175,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
