Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nTHE AMERICAN DREAM\n\nAirs Friday at 8PM ET on Fox Business Network\n\nI debate whether the American Dream is still achievable in front of thousands of people at FreedomFest in Las Vegas.\n\nTHE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN VEGAS: Steve Wynn, who has been called &quot;The master builder of Las Vegas&quot; is clearly living the dream with several mega- resorts around the world. He says the American Dream is alive and well in Silicon Valley. But he still trashes some of their products. I confront him about that.\n\nWHOLE FOODS: Government's anti-monopoly prosecution is another obstacle to the Dream. John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, was sued by the Federal Trade Commission for being a monopolist, but &quot;you don't need the government to protect people from monopolies, because the market protects people from monopolies.&quot;\n\nMINORITIES: It's much easier for whites to make it because minorities face racism and discrimination. Not true!...says Star Parker of the Center for Urban Renewal and Education.\n\nKEEPING THE DREAM ALIVE: Grover Norquist is more optimistic about the American Dream than I am. He points to the growth of home-schooling, school-choice, and other reductions of government control in the states as evidence that advocates of small government can win.\n\nMY TAKE: America is a country where if you try something and fail, that's okay. We know about Thomas Edison's success with the lightbulb, but few people know that Edison failed much more often. Henry Ford's first company failed completely. Dr. Seuss' first book was rejected by 27 publishers. Oprah was fired from her first job as a reporter, and a TV station called her &quot;unfit for TV&quot;. So when I say, &quot;idiot government regulation and high taxes are killing opportunity,&quot; ignore me and prove me wrong!\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.07.17.The.American.Dream.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 349 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 6s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 186 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nBit rate                                 : 1 047 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.159\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1047 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 6s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b94d796e4bc69c0a1854daf4dc99c32a947c781","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.07.17.The.American.Dream.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b94d796e4bc69c0a1854daf4dc99c32a947c781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,148,215,150,228,188,105,192,161,133,77,175,77,201,156,50,169,71,199,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
