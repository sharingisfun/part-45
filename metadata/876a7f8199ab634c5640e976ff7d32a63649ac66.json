It is based on a Ryu Murakami novel of the same title, from a screenplay by Daisuke Tengan. It is one of four horror films directed by Takashi Miike, the other three being One Missed Call, his contribution to the Masters of Horror series, &quot;Imprint&quot;, and his segment in the anthology film Three... Extremes, &quot;Box&quot;.\n\nOver the years, the film has developed a cult following.\n\nPlot\nShigeharu Aoyama (Aoyama Shigeharu?) (Ryo Ishibashi), a middle-aged widower of seven years, is urged by his 17-year-old son, Shigehiko Aoyama (Aoyama Shigehiko?) (Tetsu Sawaki), to begin dating again. Aoyama's friend Yasuhisa Yoshikawa (Yoshikawa Yasuhisa?) (Jun Kunimura), a film producer, devises a mock casting audition in which young women audition for the &quot;part&quot; of Aoyama's new wife. Aoyama agrees to the plan and is immediately enchanted by Asami Yamazaki (Yamazaki Asami?) (Eihi Shiina), attracted to her apparent emotional depth.\n\nYoshikawa has a bad feeling about Asami as he cannot reach any of the references on her rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ©. The music producer she claimed to work for is missing. However, Aoyama is so enthralled by her that he pursues her anyway. She lives in an empty apartment, containing a sack and a phone. For four days after the audition, she sits perfectly still next to the phone waiting for it to ring. When it finally does, she answers pretending that she never expected Aoyama to call. After several dates, she agrees to accompany him to a seaside hotel. Asami reveals that she was abused as a child and shows burn scars on her body. A deeply moved Aoyama pledges his love, and they have sex. In the morning, Asami is nowhere to be found.\n\nVideo\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nBit rate                         : 872 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\n\nEnglish subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:876a7f8199ab634c5640e976ff7d32a63649ac66","amp;dn":"%281999%29+Audition+%28Odishon%29+Uncut+h264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"876a7f8199ab634c5640e976ff7d32a63649ac66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,106,127,129,153,171,99,76,86,64,233,118,255,125,50,166,54,73,172,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
