The film was directed by Tonino Valerii and, in some scenes, by Sergio Leone.[3] It was written by Leone, Fulvio Morsella and Ernesto Gastaldi. Leone was also the uncredited executive producer. The cast includes Terence Hill, Henry Fonda, and Jean Martin.[4]\n\nJack Beauregard (Henry Fonda) is a tired, aging legendary gunslinger who just wants to retire in peace in Europe to get away from young gunmen constantly trying to test themselves against the master. The film opens with three gunmen attempting to ambush Beauregard in a barbershop. After Beauregard has dispatched them, the barber's son asks his father if there is anyone in the world faster than Beauregard, to which the barber replies &quot;Faster than him? Nobody!&quot;\n\n'Nobody' (Terence Hill) idolizes Beauregard and wants him to increase his fame by facing off the Wild Bunch singlehanded. The Wild Bunch are a gang of 150 bandits who use a fake goldmine to launder their loot. The owner of the goldmine sends them after Beauregard because Beauregard's now-dead brother was in on the deal.\n\nNobody dogs Beauregard through the West, encountering many who wish him dead, and pesters him to let him stage a grand finale. Eventually, the grand shoot-out takes place by a railway line. Nobody arranges for Beauregard to shoot at the Wild Bunch's saddles, decorated with mirrored conchos, which (as he discovered earlier) contain sticks of dynamite, thus letting a few good shots eliminate many of the men. To escape, the two board a train that Nobody has stolen.\n\nFinally, Nobody stages a very public showdown in New Orleans with Beauregard, &quot;killing&quot; him and allowing him to slip away quietly. A street sign, marking where the gunfight took place, says &quot;Nobody Was Faster On The Draw&quot;. Beauregard boards a boat for Europe and a quiet retirement, while the Wild Bunch turn their attentions from Beauregard to Nobody.\n\nTerence Hill as Nobody,Henry Fonda as Jack Beauregard,Jean Martin as Sullivan,R.G.
