The whole Code Veronica game is written in comic book format. Issue # 1 consists on 140 pages, telling the parts of the story from Claire's capture and how she is sent to Rockfort Island, until she uses the Eagle Plate to get into the building behind the guillotine stand. The story overall is the same as the game, with a more muscular design for the Bandersnatchs, a Claire that shouts a lot and very little backtracking.\n\n\nResident evil Fire And Ice # 1-4\n\nResident Evil: Fire &amp; Ice is a four-issue comic book produced by Wildstorm (who also did the Resident Evil: The Official Comic Magazine) that was published bi-monthly from December 2000 to May 2001. The story was written by Kris Oprisko and Ted Adams, with art by Lee Bermejo and Mark Irwin. The story centers around the S.T.A.R.S. Charlie team division, as they are sent to investigate a circus contaminated by the G-Virus. The comic was reprinted in a trade paperback collection by DC Comics on April 2009.\n\n\nAll in cbr","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa146d7738034d1a3d5bd84945ce7edfe46e8494","amp;dn":"Resident+Evil+comic+book+collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa146d7738034d1a3d5bd84945ce7edfe46e8494","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,20,109,119,56,3,77,26,61,91,216,73,69,206,126,223,228,110,132,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
