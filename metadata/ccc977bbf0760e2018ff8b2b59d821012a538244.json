The album comprises the contents of two separate sessions -- one recorded in 1970 with guitarist James &quot;Blood&quot; Ulmer, drummer Leroy Williams and saxophonist/flautist Marvin Cabell; the other recorded in 1969 with Cabell, Williams, and saxophonist George Coleman -- that were very similiar in concept and execution.  Patton leads his combo through a selection of originals and covers that range from Wayne Shorter and McCoy Tyner to the Meters.  Though the group is rooted in soul-jazz, they stretch the limits of the genre on these sessions, showing a willingness to experiment, while still dipping into the more traditional blues and funk reserves.  Consequently, Memphis to New York Spirit doesn't have a consistent groove like some other Patton records, but when it does click, the results are remarkable; it's a non-essential but worthy addition to a funky soul-jazz collection. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nJohn Patton (Organ) \nMarvin Cabell (Flute, Soprano and Tenor Saxophone) \nJames Blood Ulmer (Guitar) \nLeroy Williams (Drums)\n\nJohn Patton - Memphis to New York Spirit Tracks:\n01  Memphis (John Patton) 5:58 \n02  Footprints (Wayne Shorter) 6:26 \n03  The Mandingo (Marvin Cabell) 7:50 \n04  Bloodyun (John Blood Ulmer) 8:20 \n05  Steno (John Patton) 9:18 \n06  Man from Tanganyika (McCoy Tyner) 6:21 \n07  Cissy Strut (Ziggy Modeliste/Art Neville/Leo Nocentelli/George Porter, Jr.) 6:58 \n08  Dragon Slayer (Marvin Cabell) 6:36\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccc977bbf0760e2018ff8b2b59d821012a538244","amp;dn":"John+Patton+-+Memphis+to+New+York+Spirit+%281970%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccc977bbf0760e2018ff8b2b59d821012a538244","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,201,119,187,240,118,14,32,24,255,139,43,89,216,33,1,42,83,130,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
