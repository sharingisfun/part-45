The reports of the Prophet's sayings and deeds are called ahadith. Muslim lived a couple of centuries after the Prophet's death and worked extremely hard to collect his ahadith. Each report in his collection was checked for compatibility with the Qur'an, and the veracity of the chain of reporters had to be\npainstakingly established. Muslim's collection is recognized by the overwhelming majority of the Muslim world to be one of the most authentic collections of the Sunnah of the Prophet (pbuh).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec7df89b049fcc7af17b3252b7d4f24d2abd2ab2","amp;dn":"Sahih+Muslim+Hadith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec7df89b049fcc7af17b3252b7d4f24d2abd2ab2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,125,248,155,4,159,204,122,241,123,50,82,183,212,242,77,42,189,42,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
