A polite, well-deported gentleman, he comes to Stone seeking legal expertise on an unusualÃ¢â‚¬â€and potentially lucrativeÃ¢â‚¬â€dilemma. Stone points him in the right direction and sends him on his way, but it's soon clear Stone hasn't seen the end of the case. Several people are keenly interested in this gentleman's activities and how they may relate to a long-ago crime . . . and some of them will stop at nothing to find the information they desire. \n\n On a hunt that leads from Florida's tropical beaches to the posh vacation homes of the Northeast, Stone finds himself walking a tightrope between ambitious authorities and seedy lowlifes who all have the same prize in their sights. In this cutthroat contest of wills, it's winner-takes-all . . . and Stone will need every bit of his cunning and resourcefulness to be the last man standing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:075b85c708b99ed536dbdb7c0bc56ad79aa11b9c","amp;dn":"Standup+Guy+By+Stuart+Woods-Stone+Barrington+28-Epub+Mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"075b85c708b99ed536dbdb7c0bc56ad79aa11b9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,91,133,199,8,185,158,213,54,219,219,124,11,197,106,215,154,161,27,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
