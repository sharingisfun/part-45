First released on the 1980 album Argybargy, it received positive critical reviews, peaked at #44 on the UK Singles Chart, and became one of Squeeze's most popular songs. The song is about one of the band members' experiences at a holiday camp. \n\nThe song &quot;Pulling Mussels&quot; was written by band members Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook. According to critic Chris Woodstra, it is an &quot;observation of the British working class&quot; and &quot;offers a series of detailed snapshots of the different walks of life on a seaside holiday.&quot;\n\nThe phrase &quot;pulling mussels&quot; is British slang for sexual intercourse.\n\nThe song features piano playing by keyboardist Jools Holland.\n\n&quot;Pulling Mussels&quot; received positive reviews from music critics. It has been variously described as &quot;a timeless cult classic&quot;, &quot;a brilliant slice of pop genius&quot;, &quot;a pop classic of the new wave era&quot;, and &quot;a piece of pop mastery&quot;. In 2007, Anna Borg wrote, &quot;The build up before the chorus always gets me, even 25 years later.&quot; Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the song as &quot;a vivid portrait of a seaside vacation where Difford's vignettes are made all the more vivid by Tilbrook's bright, invigorating pop.&quot; It is regarded as one of Squeeze's catchiest songs.\n\n&quot;Pulling Mussels&quot; is a &quot;crowd favorite&quot; at Squeeze concerts. The band performed the song on Saturday Night Live on 20 November 1982. They played the song at concerts during the 1980s and early 1990s. In 2001, it was the finale of a Glenn Tilbrook show in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. Squeeze played &quot;Pulling Mussels&quot; last during concerts in 2010.\n\n\nSqueeze are a British band who came to prominence in the United Kingdom during the new wave period of the late 1970s and continued recording successfully in the 1980s and 1990s. They are known in the UK for their hit songs &quot;Cool for Cats&quot;, &quot;Up the Junction&quot;, &quot;Tempted&quot;, &quot;Labelled with Love&quot;, &quot;Black Coffee in Bed&quot;, &quot;Another Nail in My Heart&quot;, &quot;Pulling Mussels (from the Shell)&quot; and &quot;Hourglass&quot;. Though not as commercially successful in the United States, Squeeze had American chart hits with &quot;Tempted&quot;, &quot;Hourglass&quot; and &quot;853-5937&quot;, and they have a dedicated following there and continue to attract new fans. All of Squeeze's hits were written by band members Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, with the former penning the lyrics and the latter handling the composition. The duo were hailed as &quot;the heirs to Lennon and McCartney's throne&quot; during their peak of popularity in the early 1980s.\n\nThe group formed in Deptford, London, in 1974, and first broke up in 1982. Squeeze then reformed in 1985, and disbanded again in 1999. The band reunited for tours through the United States and United Kingdom in 2007, and this touring version of Squeeze has continued.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulling_Mussels_(from_the_Shell)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulling_Mussels_(from_the_Shell)&lt;/a&gt;  \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAGBFaaga&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAGBFaaga&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:42\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
