In this book the more important processes that are driven by microbiological activity are discussed. It will be of interest to students of chemistry, biology, ecology, soil science and related areas. Researchers from these fields will profit from extended literature surveys in each chapter comprising important findings from early as well as the most recent investigations.\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\nSoil and Soil Life; Aerobic and Anaerobic Degradation of Monomer and Polymer Plant Constituents by Soil Microorganisms; Humus and Humification; Turnover of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Sulfur in Soils and Sediments; Composting and Fermentation of Organic Materials; Trace Gases in Soil; Heavy Metals as Pollutants: Toxicity, Environmental Aspects, Resistance and Biotechnological Aspects","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1eea95184a888635df7787f1259338d0c0f2bfaa","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+Soil+Biochemistry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1eea95184a888635df7787f1259338d0c0f2bfaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,234,149,24,74,136,134,53,223,119,135,241,37,147,56,208,192,242,191,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
