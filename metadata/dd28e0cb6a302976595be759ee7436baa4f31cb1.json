The program is truly universal, since it recovers all types of files: digital images, archives, text documents, video and music files, executable files and so on. The tool recovers data lost after quick or full formatting, deletion of logical partitions on hard drives, flash drives and memory cards. The software will recover the structure of your disk after file system errors and corruption of the boot sector.\n\nThe program meets all safety requirements for data recovery. When scanning a drive and recovering files, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t write anything to it, thus protecting deleted files from overwriting. When working with a damaged or faulty hard drive, it is very important to keep the number of read operations as low as possible. In such cases, the program allows you to create a virtual copy of the damaged disk and continue recovering data from it.\n\nYou can download the hard drive recovery program for free. A detailed help file and a built-in step-by-step wizard will make data recovery a task that even inexperienced users will have no problems with.
