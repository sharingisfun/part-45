He treats these primary texts of Western civilization with a dignity and respect accorded to the Gospels, setting them to a noble music of a pellucid crystallinity--a dialectical &quot;white music&quot; of blanc et noir son gris.\nThe overall ethos is extraordinarily subtle and detached, self-effaced and equitable, while featuring an unction--an internal momentum--of unmistakable imagination. This concentration imposes a prÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cis upon a sensible auditor who may psychically be transported into the mise-en-scÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ne itself: withal, the effect is spellbinding and transcendent.\n.\nThe reading here is superb, and this disc in particular is very satisfactory as it features Socrate as the primary work and supplements it with the contemporaneous Nocturnes, making for a very nice and aesthetically unified programme. Billy Eidi is expert with this French material, and Jean Belliard's light tenor fits the bill. \n(amazon.com)\n\n\nFormat: AAC (neroAacEnc)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f55460d9457c106ab9da922035276b6d5308b56f","amp;dn":"Erik+Satie%3A+Socrate+%26+6+Nocturnes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f55460d9457c106ab9da922035276b6d5308b56f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,84,96,217,69,124,16,106,185,218,146,32,53,39,107,109,83,8,181,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
