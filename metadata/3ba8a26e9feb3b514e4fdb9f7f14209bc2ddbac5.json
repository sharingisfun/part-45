Excited and not a little scared, they packed up their three childrenÃ¢â‚¬â€ages two, four, and sevenÃ¢â‚¬â€and headed for adventure and uncertainty in Beijing, China.\n\nBased on his award-winning Wall Street Journal Online column, &quot;The Expat Life,&quot; Big in China explores Paul's unlikely three-and-a-half-year journey of reinvention in this rapidly developing metropolis. He reveals the challenges that he and his family faced while living in a foreign land, including reaching beyond the expat community, coming to terms with his new role as a stay-at-home dad, and learning to navigate and thrive in an unfamiliar culture. By viewing an intimidating challenge as a golden opportunity rather than as a burden, he saw his world open up around him.\n\nAt the heart of the memoir is his time fronting Woodie Alan, a blues band he formed with a Chinese partner. The cross-cultural collaboration became an unlikely success. The band embarked on a tour across China, earning the title &quot;Best Band in Beijing&quot; and recording an acclaimed CD of original music sung in both English and Mandarin, which prompted ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons to say, &quot;This is the best Chinese blues band I ever heard. Who knew?&quot; Woodie Alan was symbolic of Paul's entire China experience and?proof of what transpires when one can suspend preconceived notions and plunge into a new reality.\n\nA testament to the transformative power of a life lived beyond comfortable borders, Big in China reminds us of the importance of always keeping our horizons wide and our thoughts ambitious","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ba8a26e9feb3b514e4fdb9f7f14209bc2ddbac5","amp;dn":"Big+in+China+Alan+Paul+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ba8a26e9feb3b514e4fdb9f7f14209bc2ddbac5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,168,162,110,159,235,59,81,78,79,219,159,127,20,32,155,194,221,186,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
