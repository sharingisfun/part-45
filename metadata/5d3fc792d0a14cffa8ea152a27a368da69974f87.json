She had on a psychedelic wig of tinsel, too, which coordinated nicely with the sparkly wreath (?) Mr. Coyne, 53, wore around his neck.\n\nMiley joined the Flaming Lips for their rendition of &quot;A Day in the Life,&quot; a song from their recently released Beatles cover album, With a Little Help from My Fwends. The erstwhile Disney star is featured on another album song, tooÃ¢â‚¬â€&quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.&quot; Moby, believe it or not, is featured on that one, too.\n\nBack in July, Miley starred in a bizarre, NSFW video with the Flaming Lips called, &quot;Blonde SuperFreak Steals the Magic Brain.&quot; The clip also featured Moby, who, as Wayne tried to explain to Rolling Stone, played &quot;an evil, power-hungry cult leader.&quot;\n\nWayne continued: &quot;He [Moby] wants the world's most valuable (according to our story) psychedelic supernatural possession... John F. Kennedy's brain....the brain contains the original formula for the drug LSD!!!&quot;\nSomehow, Miley got her hands on &quot;the magic brain,&quot; and Moby &quot;enlists a nymph Manson girl-type blonde superfreak&quot; to steal it back. In the video, Wayne explained that this &quot;freak&quot; is able to steal the brain &quot;while Cyrus is still in bed in a drug-induced coma.&quot;\n\n&quot;She enlists a burned-faced Santa and a lesbian Bigfoot (that are hovering in a nearby spaceship) to hunt down the blond superfreak that stole her brain,&quot; Wayne told the mag, noting that all the while, the Flaming Lips &quot;are disguised as rainbows, mushrooms and flowers watching from the sky room where a giant diamond explosion happens.&quot;\n\nOh, boy. Some of this stuff is definitely an acquired taste. As for the album itself? There's one thing everyone will like about it! Per NPR, All proceeds from With a Little Help From My Fwends benefit The Bella Foundation, an Oklahoma City organization that helps provide veterinary care to needy pet owners.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.eonline.com/news/595875/miley-cyrus-joins-flaming-lips-for-bizarre-a-day-in-the-life-performance-watch-now?cmpid=rss-000000-rssfeed-365-celebritynews&amp;utm_source=eonline&amp;utm_medium=rssfeeds&amp;utm_campaign=rss_celebritynews&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.eonline.com/news/595875/miley-cyrus-joins-flaming-lips-for-bizarre-a-day-in-the-life-performance-watch-now?cmpid=rss-000000-rssfeed-365-celebritynews&amp;utm_source=eonline&amp;utm_medium=rssfeeds&amp;utm_campaign=rss_celebritynews&lt;/a&gt;\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nThat's When I Reached For My Revolver Album!\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n\n\nI can see for miles and miles and miles \nOf smiles of Smiley in the Sky with Diamonds\n\n2014-11-08 around thewaymouth aka mikedreams on...The Pirate Bay on...\nMiley and all that and a bag of clips. \nCheers, dears!\n\n\nAnd if you have to say you don't like Her, then what in Uncle Sam Hell are you doing here and not busy being airborne on the wings of the ones you love? \n\n\nMethinks the trolls doth protest too much. Coming in out of the cold cold cold and into the flame on, to state hate and throw stones at what other people do to share what's been raising the hair on the back of their heads of late -- hey why here you go buddy, have a pull of the cuff off my found stuff. Are you kind, one of my kind, if so then join in the joy of the world at the sight of a girl all lit up for all to find and show love -- and hate too, for something seems amiss, a miss bliss kiss that is missing in their own lives and in themselves that they have nothing better to do than to try to make everyone else around and about as miserably misogynistic as them.\n\n\nI do not hang around your whipping posts to harangue your old as ass, classic pet rocks in sheets, covering up for the flogging of a dead horse's rotten remains, to remain unnamed and unknown by me as much as possible, for I don't have the time to be caught listening to what dead man turns you on, so please live and let live and die and leave now, or if you must forever throw up your plate of hate all over the place like how you do, I will clean your clockwork talk like usual. You brought it, I swat it. Jealousy is so ugly. But I'm a garbage man, so let it out and then get it over with and into the can. There's plenty of room in this room for all that is younger than that now, as well as all the old holier than thou high priests going to the wishing well once too often.\n\n\nNow where was I before I was rudely interrupted by the self-righteous right-wingnuts inside my head harshing my buzzcut season anyway?\n\n&quot;You have no right to judge me... Because it's judgment that defeats us.&quot; \n\nWhy then am I hearing is their music calling for a flood of Miley? \n\nAll right then, just try me and let's all go crazy with peace signs and love for Cyrus sake!\n\n\nMany years ago, there was a man who said, is it rolling, Bob? \n\n&quot;you are right john cohen - quazimodo was right - Mozart was right.... I cannot say the word eye anymore .... when I speak this word eye, it is as if I am speaking of somebody's eye that I faintly remember .... there is no eye there is only a series of mouths - long live the mouths - your rooftop if you don't already know - has been demolished .... eye is plasma &amp; you are right about that too - you are lucky - you don't have to think about such things as eyes &amp; rooftops &amp; quazimodo.&quot;\n\n&amp; Smiley.\n\n\nWe can't &amp; we don't stop\ntill we get it up &amp; on &amp; off\nwith one hand waving free \nand the other to let fly\nLucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\n\nIt's all about The Climb\nin the back with your head in the clouds\nand you're gone\n \n_______________\n\n\n\nMiley Instagram... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/MileyInstagram.jpg~original&quot;
