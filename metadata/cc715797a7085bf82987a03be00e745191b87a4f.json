But when the fame goes to \nhis head, Brian gets a wake-up call from \nBill Maher (guest-voicing as himself). \nMeanwhile, Lois decides that she and Peter \nneed separate beds, a decision that leaves \nPeter looking for a new cuddle buddy.\n\nThere is 5 minutes of live-action footage\nin this episode that is actually 30fps.\nBeing that this was 25% of the episode, we\nfelt it would be beest to leave it all at\n30 and not incur any jerky playback during\nthe live action footage. No ghosting or\njerky playback results in the remaining\n75% either.\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc715797a7085bf82987a03be00e745191b87a4f","amp;dn":"Family.Guy.S09E06.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc715797a7085bf82987a03be00e745191b87a4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,113,87,151,167,8,91,248,41,135,160,59,224,14,116,81,145,184,122,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
