The development team at LucasArts is bringing the game into the modern era with an all new re-imagined contemporary art style, a re-mastered musical score, full voiceover, and an in-depth hint system to help players through the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s side-splitting puzzles. Purists will also delight in the ability to seamlessly switch between the updated hand-drawn re-imagining and the original classic version.\nThe game's twisty plot leads our naive hero on a hilarious, swash-buckling search for the fabled secret of Monkey Island.

If clever enough, he will win the confidence of MÃƒÂªlÃƒÂ©e's pirates and find himself blown by the winds of fate toward the terrifying and legendary Monkey Island -- an adventure that would chill the bones of even the most bloodthirsty buccaneer.\n\n\nFeatures:\n==========\nGo on a daring adventure in your attempt to become the most infamous pirate in the Caribbean!\nScene-for-scene hot swap allows for seamless transition between special edition and classic modes anywhere and at any time.\nComplete voice over using the original Monkey IslandÃ¢â€žÂ¢ franchise cast brings the story and characters of the original adventures to life like never before.\n\n\nVersion:\n==========\nGame version 1.0 or GOG setup 2.0.0.6, from October 27, 2014.\nIt is also the only version released\n\n\nInstructions:\n==============\nLaunch Setup and Install\nPlay - Enjoy - Seed!\n \n\nSystem Requirements:\n=====================\nOperating System: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 \nProcessor: Intel Pentium 4 3GHz or AMD Athlon 64 3000+\nVideo card: GeForce 6800 Series 128MB/Radeon 9600 Series\nSystem memory: 512 MB RAM\nHard disk drive: 2.5 GB available space \n\n\n\n\n           If you enjoyed the game then share with others by seeding\n                        Remember to support quality games","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53c8f6a52443f0cc4350702cea3a1425bbe1ae37","amp;dn":"The+Secret+of+Monkey+Island+Special+Edition+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53c8f6a52443f0cc4350702cea3a1425bbe1ae37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,200,246,165,36,67,240,204,67,80,112,44,234,58,20,37,187,225,174,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
