He is in search of gold. The others are a former ship Captain, also in search of the gold; the Woman from England, a former chambermaid who, in exchange for ship's passage to America, has signed an agreement to serve the Captain for five years as an indentured servant; and Mr. Rainbow, a former soldier who killed Indians.\n\nThe Captain sets out to find some of Montezuma's gold, risking danger from both the Native Indians and Mexican soldiers. The woman wants to get out of her contract with the Captain and go to New Orleans. She asks Mr. Rainbow to take her there, but he turns her down.\n\nThe Scalphunter wants half of the Captain's gold, and tags along with his men. Mr. Rainbow sets out across the desert through the Viaje de la Muerte, the Journey of Death.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 105 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 105 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b86245f88db52d3f1e89dd97b7dc3276f107520","amp;dn":"Shoot+the+Sun+Down+%281978%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Western+-+Margot+Kidder%2C+Ch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b86245f88db52d3f1e89dd97b7dc3276f107520","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,134,36,95,136,219,82,211,241,232,157,217,123,125,195,39,111,16,117,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
