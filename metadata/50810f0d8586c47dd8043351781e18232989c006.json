Gordon&quot;)\nProduced by David F. Friedman (&quot;Davis Freeman&quot;)\n\nStarring Rusty Allen and Jerry Eden (&quot;Jerry Stallion&quot;)\n\nFilmed in black/white and color (for nature camp sequences)\n\nSchool board in sunny Florida learns that teacher Rusty Allen is a nudist in private life.  How do you think they react?\n\nTorrent includes two short (10 minute) films from the Something Weird DVD &quot;Diary of a Nudist / Naked Venus&quot; -- 1) They Wear No Clothes and 2) Nudist Recruits -- both were made in the 1930s, I believe.\n\nTech Specs (I mention these because Daughter of the Sun looks a little gnarly, mostly because of its age &amp; the nature of the film stock. It is a VHS dub from the Something Weird VHS of this film.)\n\nDaughter of the Sun -- Captured to PC as an MPG @ 5000 kbps, then converted to MP4 with Nero Recode @ 2.02 mbps -- 29.97 fps\n\nShort films from DVD -- converted to MPG @ 5000 kbps, then converted to MP4 with Nero Recode @ 2.02 mbps -- 23.98 fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50810f0d8586c47dd8043351781e18232989c006","amp;dn":"Daughter+of+the+Sun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50810f0d8586c47dd8043351781e18232989c006","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,129,15,13,133,134,196,125,216,4,51,81,120,30,24,35,41,137,192,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
