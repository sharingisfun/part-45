I am not responsible for any negative out comes that may happen with the process. (There is not virus in these files. You can scan them yourself. I use Norton and I never even got false positives.) This is the full game. If you would like to play online just use Tunngle. Although this should work with steam too. Just launch it from the shortcut. Not steam. Enjoy.\n\nPowerISO: http://www.poweriso.com/download.htm\nWinRaR: http://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&amp;L=0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:840e0ac56ce4a2329a18f22d8f493510ea912842","amp;dn":"Killing+Floor+v1047+%7ESteamWorks%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"840e0ac56ce4a2329a18f22d8f493510ea912842","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,14,10,197,108,228,162,50,154,24,242,45,143,73,53,16,234,145,40,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
