It features the six French Watchmen covers (that I'm not sure were done by Gibbons - they have no signature), six promotional posters and the original twelve U.S. covers. Probably only for the hardcore Watchmen completists, but it's a vibrant, high quality scan of something I'd never seen before so I thought I;d pass it along.\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08344696c8959ca057f97340fd3b1cd54081e5fb","amp;dn":"Watchmen+Portfolio+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08344696c8959ca057f97340fd3b1cd54081e5fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,52,70,150,200,149,156,160,87,249,115,64,253,59,28,213,64,129,229,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
