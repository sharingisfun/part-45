Still, they had many, many songs that were played heavily on the radio, even if they didn't officially make the charts. The ten-track budget-line collection Super Hits balances the two extremes, taking their two biggest hits -- &quot;(Don't Fear) the Reaper&quot; and &quot;Burnin' for You,&quot; naturally -- and supporting them with AOR staples such as &quot;This Ain't the Summer of Love,&quot; &quot;Godzilla,&quot; &quot;The Red and the Black,&quot; &quot;Black Blade,&quot; &quot;Screaming Diz Busters,&quot; &quot;Flaming Telepaths,&quot; &quot;Goin' Through the Motions&quot; and &quot;O.D.'d on Life Itself.&quot; Yes, there are many cult favorites missing, but this nevertheless presents a pretty good cross-section of their best stuff, making it worthwhile for casual fans on a budget.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0fa46a48d7f3bed1c5d8cca4e799fd2e3574d85","amp;dn":"Blue+Oyster+Cult+-+Super+Hits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0fa46a48d7f3bed1c5d8cca4e799fd2e3574d85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,250,70,164,141,127,59,237,28,93,140,202,78,121,159,210,227,87,77,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
