Listen to the sound samples.\nAutomatically compares microphones and generates correction algorithms. Averaged models of microphones are not used because every microphone is unique and requires a unique correction algorithm.\nConverts a pair of identical (same model) microphones into a matched pair of microphones for stereo recording.\nEnsures verifiable quality replication. Turn your medium quality microphone into a replica of a high quality microphone and compare the sounds immediately.\nCorrects both amplitude and phase components of the microphone frequency response.\nApplies a patented method of microphone correction which ensures maximum similarity between the sound of the reference microphone and the sound of the target microphone.\n\n- VST* effect plug-in for music creation software.\nPlatforms: Windows 7/Vista/XP\n\n\n\n\nMathAudio Pickup Corrector VST\n\nCorrects the sound of pickups of musical instruments to make the signal spectrum similar to the signal spectrum of your favorite microphone. Listen to the sound samples.\nAllows sound recording in a relatively noisy environment because pickups are less sensitive to noisy environments than microphones.\nContains an optional &quot;Air&quot; feature which simulates the sound reflections that are usually present in microphone signals.\nApplies a patented method of pickup correction which is applicable to a variety of pickups, including piezo pickups, magnetic pickups and mic pickups.\n\n- VST* effect plug-in for music creation software.\nPlatforms: Windows 7/Vista/XP\n\n\n\n\nMathAudio Auto EQ VST\n\nCorrects acoustic imperfections of speakers, headphones and earphones.\nCorrects deficiencies of room acoustics (multipoint compensation).\nCorrects both amplitude and phase components of frequency response.\nQuells resonance peaks of frequency response while leaving the deep notches to prevent large excursions of the speaker diaphragm. Avoids the muddy sound of conventional linearizing equalizers.\nContains built-in frequency responses of ideal speakers, headphones and earphones and uses them as references.\nAllows drawing one's own reference frequency response.\nManually adjustable level of compensation allows one to reach the maximum transparency of the sound.\nPerfect for use with standard measurement microphones. Even a cheap measurement microphone like Behringer ECM8000 ensures the accuracy of +/- 2 dB which is enough for professional musical applications.\nA patented method of the frequency response correction ensures maximum accuracy of the compensation.\n\n- VST* effect plug-in for music creation software.\nPlatforms: Windows 7/Vista/XP\n\n\n\nMathAudio Fast EQ \n\nAllows drawing the necessary frequency response by a single movement of the mouse.\nApplies a fast synthesis algorithm for the propmt change of the frequency response.\nEnsures maximum freedom for experimenting with the sound.\nAllows working with a chosen frequency band without affecting neighbouring frequency bands.\nChanges the frequency response in a wide range of +/- 20 dB.\nAdapted to all sampling rates above 40 kHz.\n\n- VST* effect plug-in for music creation software.\nPlatforms: Windows 7/Vista/XP\n\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ You need WinRar or other extractor of your choice to extract the rar file\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Install Setup.\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it! Done.\n\n\n                     3Nj0Y!!!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:632da088cb058f2041028254967728dabf39bb19","amp;dn":"MathAudio+PACK+4In1+-+R2R+%5Bdeepstatus%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"632da088cb058f2041028254967728dabf39bb19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,45,160,136,203,5,143,32,65,2,130,84,150,119,40,218,191,57,187,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
