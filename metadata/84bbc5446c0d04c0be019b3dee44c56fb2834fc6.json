From his FIRST Rune novel 'Manhattan Is My Beat' published in 1988 to his most recent James Bond novel 'Carte Blanche' published this year, 2011, it's all here.\n\nOf the 28 E-Books, some are in PDF format, for which you'll need Adobe Acrobat Reader (or any PDF reader, really), but it's mostly in MOBI format. I've also included MOBI Pocket Reader which you can use to read the books on your PC.\n\nOh, and one book is in HTML format. Which can be opened in ANY web-browser. If, for some reason, you think that you don't have a web-browser, you are an utterly idiotic fool. No offense. Nah, take offense if you want to.\n\nT4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84bbc5446c0d04c0be019b3dee44c56fb2834fc6","amp;dn":"Jeffery+Deaver+Entire+Collection+Up-To-Date+%2828+E-Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84bbc5446c0d04c0be019b3dee44c56fb2834fc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,187,197,68,108,13,4,192,190,1,155,61,238,68,197,111,178,131,79,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
