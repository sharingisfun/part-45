Of course there&amp;#039;s danger of plagiarism with every electronic act as we know it but Komputer albeit so obviously rearranging, somehow maintained the innovation and difference to the original blueprints, in their own right producing unique and often humouristic music...\n\nOriginally formed as avant-electronic pop duo I Start Counting releasing plenty of singles and couple of excellent state-of-technology albums, then resurrecting as equally thrilling Fortran 5 on the verge of the nineties rave-culture. Komputer finally settled in 1996. with their self-titled debut EP which launched The Model-esque hit &amp;#039;Valentina Tereshkova&amp;#039; (also known as &amp;#039;Valentina&amp;#039;)... One more single followed that same year, &amp;#039;Looking Down on London&amp;#039;, before &amp;#039;The World of Tomorrow&amp;#039;, in 1998. Their first proper long-player is also worth noting tracks like &amp;#039;Bill Gates&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Terminus Interminus&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;More Automation&amp;#039; furtherly streching Kraftwerk into Komputer&amp;#039;s subversive form of recycling... In 2002 Komputer released their second, long awaited album, but unlike the soothing synth-pop of &amp;#039;Tomorrow&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Market Led&amp;#039; is rather abbrasive take on vynil noise sampled into obscure ambience... By recognising themselves in the underground&amp;#039;s recent fashions, Komputer slowly drifted apart from their earlier infatuations...\n\n\nTracklisting:\n\n01 - Looking Down On London\n02 - DLR\n03 - Looking Down On London (Underground London)\n04 - Looking Down On London (Metroland)\n\n\nKids, always remember Xenu is your friend.\n\nwww.xenu.net\n\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:617e0a07617321281ba245f733cb7dd9779c3341","amp;dn":"%5BSynth+%2F+Electronic%5D+Komputer+-+Looking+down+on+London+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"617e0a07617321281ba245f733cb7dd9779c3341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,126,10,7,97,115,33,40,27,162,69,247,51,203,125,217,119,156,51,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
