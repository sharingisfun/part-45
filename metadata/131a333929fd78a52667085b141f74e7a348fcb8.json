Only now that world's exquisite perfection propels one restless young man toward the ultimate challenge.\r\n\r\nThe Wellstone\r\n\r\nFor the children of immortal parents, growing up can be hard to do. A prince will forever be a prince--leaving no chance for Bascal Edward de Towaji Lutui to inherit his parents' throne. So what is an angry young blue blood to do? Punch a hole in the shadow he has been living in by rallying his equally disgruntled companions to make an improbable spaceship, busting out of the so-called summer camp in which their parents have stowed them and making a daring escape across the vastness of space. Neer-do-well Conrad Mursk is just along for the joyride--until he realizes this is no typical display of teenage angst. The children are rising up in an honest-to-gods revolution. And, boyo, things are going to get raw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 96 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:131a333929fd78a52667085b141f74e7a348fcb8","amp;dn":"Wil+McCarthy+-+The+Wellstone+%28The+Queendom+of+Sol+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"131a333929fd78a52667085b141f74e7a348fcb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,26,51,57,41,253,120,165,38,103,8,91,20,31,116,231,163,72,252,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
