It has been 10 years now since the first Endoscopy Forum Japan was held, and in that time, leading young endoscopists, including colleagues from Asia, Australia, Europe, and the United States, have participated in the forum, discussing issues at the forefront of the field. Through their efforts, GI endoscopy has advanced with many new methods for both diagnoses and treatments, and those achievements are included in this book. Contributing to the development of endoscopic medicine all over the world, this is a groundbreaking, edifying, and engrossing publication offering the most recent advances in the field, precisely presented and depicted with more than 250 color photographs. Novel technologies are described in detail and will be of interest to those in the field of medicine and in engineering as well.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f96205275991b14f0302f3f595b84d975d0f589a","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2008%5D+New+Challenges+in+Gastrointestional+Endoscopy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f96205275991b14f0302f3f595b84d975d0f589a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,98,5,39,89,145,177,79,3,2,243,245,149,184,77,151,93,15,88,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
