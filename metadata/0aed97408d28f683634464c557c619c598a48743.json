The exact location of borders became paramount; playwright and screenwriter Stein amasses the story of each state's border, channeling them into a cohesive whole. Proceeding through the states alphabetically, Stein takes the innovative step of addressing each border-north, south, east, west-separately. Border stories shine a spotlight on many aspects of American history: the 49th parallel was chosen for the northern borders of Minnesota, North Dakota, and Montana because they ensured England's access to the Great Lakes, vital to their fur trade; in 1846, Washington D.C. residents south of the Potomac successfully petitioned to rejoin Virginia (called both -retrocession- and -a crime-) in order to keep out free African-Americans. Aside from tales of violent conquest and political glad-handing, there's early, breathtaking tales of American politicos' favorite sport, gerrymandering (in 1864, Idaho judge Sidney Edgerton single-handedly -derailed- Idaho's proposed boundary, to Montana's benefit, with $2,000 in gold). American history enthusiasts should be captivated by this fun, informative text. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/How-States-Got-Their-Shapes/dp/0061431397/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374583580&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=how+the+states+got+their+shapes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/How-States-Got-Their-Shapes/dp/0061431397/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374583580&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=how+the+states+got+their+shapes&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aed97408d28f683634464c557c619c598a48743","amp;dn":"How+the+States+Got+Their+Shapes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aed97408d28f683634464c557c619c598a48743","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,237,151,64,141,40,246,131,99,68,100,197,87,198,25,197,152,164,135,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
