Some start with a\nmelody or a beat; some begin with a lyric. Whatever your\nstarting point, you need to get your ideas down quickly, and\nthen polish them into songs that are worth sharing: on the\nweb, with songwriting partners, or even with publishers. This\nshort course is all about using Ableton Live to do just that\nYeuda Ben-Atar demonstrates his techniques for writing\nrecording, and mixing a song in Ableton Live in just one\nhour. He starts from an empty Ableton Live project, and then\nhe creates a beat, lays down additional software and\nreal-instrument tracks, and adds effects and automation\nNext, he records vocals and mixes the track with effects like\nEQ, compression, reverb, and delay. Finally, he shows how to\nbounce down the track and share your song with the world. So\ndive in and learn to capture your musical ideas before\ninspiration fades\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nUnpack, burn or mount and enjoy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9997751e16ed20b8692cba30c44d429eaf8c13fd","amp;dn":"Lynda.com.Songwriting.in.Ableton.Live-QUASAR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9997751e16ed20b8692cba30c44d429eaf8c13fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,151,117,30,22,237,32,184,105,44,186,48,196,77,66,158,175,140,19,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
