This information has been kept in Top Secret government files since the 1940s. His audiences hear the truth unfold as he writes about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the war on drugs, the Secret Government, and UFOs.\n\nIn 1988 Bill decided to &quot;talk&quot; due to events then taking place worldwide, events which he had seen plans for back in the early 70s. Since Bill has been &quot;talking&quot; he has correctly predicted the lowering of the Iron Curtain, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the invasion of Panama. All Bill's predictions were on record well before the events occurred. Bill is not a psychic. His information comes from Top Secret documents that he read while with the Intelligence Briefing Team and from over 17 years of thorough research. This is one of Bills lecture about the new world order, UFO's and even moonbases.\n\nVideo Codec: DivX 5.X\nVideo: 777 ~kbit/s\nRuntime: 4h 40 min.\nAudio Format: ~192 kbit/s MP3 CBR\nAspect Ratio: 4:3\nFrame Size: 352x288\nFramerate: 29,970 fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5f70e76beeff49501933ec6e78d83fb7427cd02","amp;dn":"%28NWO%29+William+Cooper+Expose+the+NWO+-+Behold+a+Pale+Horse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5f70e76beeff49501933ec6e78d83fb7427cd02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,247,14,118,190,239,244,149,1,147,62,198,231,141,131,251,116,39,205,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
