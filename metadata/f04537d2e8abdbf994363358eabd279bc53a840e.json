A deadly viral outbreak occurs, and in response, the Red Queen - a vast supercomputer that controls and monitors the Hive - seals the entire facility to contain the leak, killing all the trapped employees. Alice and Rain must lead fellow commandos to isolate the virus that has wiped out Umbrella's entire research staff. The team soon discovers, however, that the workers are not really dead. They are now the ravenous, zombie-like Undead, and they are prowling the hive and turning their victims into zombies. Alice and the military task force have three hours to complete their mission before the Undead threaten to overrun the Earth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f04537d2e8abdbf994363358eabd279bc53a840e","amp;dn":"Resident+Evil+%282002%29+DvD+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f04537d2e8abdbf994363358eabd279bc53a840e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,69,55,210,232,171,219,249,148,54,51,88,234,189,39,155,197,58,132,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
