There are twenty-five meticulous drawings produced by horticultural researchers who actually dug, troweled, dusted, mapped, and drew their way through entire growing root systems, down to the tiniest root. The resulting illustrations are a revelation of the beauty contained in the actual patterns, and habits of rooting plants. Guidelines also provide a home gardener with tips for the practical use of the new information.\n\nThe vegetable root drawings were done by Dr. Weaver in the 1930s in Nebraska who actually dug, troweled, dusted, mapped, and drew his way through entire growing root systems, down to the tiniest root.\n\n\n\nDid you know?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ About 90% of a treeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roots are to be found in the top 18 inches of the soil.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ At the end of its first yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s growth, an apple tree can incorporate as many as 17,000,000 root hairs with a total length of well over a mile!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The glorious magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), can grow roots 3.77 times wider than the dripline.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A measly turnip can produce roots that explore 100 cubic feet of soil (enough Ã¢â‚¬Å“dirtÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to fill 20-25 wheelbarrows), and the roots of the lowly lima-bean bush as much as 200 to 225 cubic feet.\n\nThe book has a total of 70 B&amp;W illustrations.\n\n\n\n\nIf you like this book, please support the Author by buying it (or making a donation).
