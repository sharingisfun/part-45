If you ever heard it on the radio, you'll find it on here, from the catchy &quot;The One Thing&quot; to the funky &quot;Need You Tonight&quot; and the pounding &quot;What You Need.&quot; The sadly departed Michael Hutchence does have a Jagger-like charisma, which often trancends the three-chords-and-a-beat tunes and sometimes treacly lyrics. I was pleased to see that &quot;Disappear,&quot; the best song off the otherwise forgettable &quot;X&quot;, is here as well. Diehard fans nitpick at the song selection, but casual fans like myself enjoy this immensely. \n\nby New World Smurf &quot;new_world_smurf&quot;\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - The One Thing.wma                                      \n02 - Original Sin.wma                                       \n03 - What You Need.wma                                      \n04 - Listen Like Thieves.wma                                \n05 - Shine Like It Does.wma                                 \n06 - Need You Tonight.wma                                   \n07 - Devil Inside.wma                                       \n08 - New Sensation.wma                                      \n09 - Never Tear Us Apart.wma                                \n10 - Suicide Blonde.wma                                     \n11 - Disappear.wma                                          \n12 - The Stairs.wma                                         \n13 - Heaven Sent.wma                                        \n14 - Beautiful Girl.wma                                     \n15 - The Strangest Party (These Are the Times).wma          \n16 - Deliver Me.wma      \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4afbbf530e47127f780590913c5d8e7cd835c864","amp;dn":"INXS+-+Greatest+Hits+%281994%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4afbbf530e47127f780590913c5d8e7cd835c864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,251,191,83,14,71,18,127,120,5,144,145,60,93,142,124,216,53,200,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
