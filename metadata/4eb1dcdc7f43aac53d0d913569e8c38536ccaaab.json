Install Windows 7 Ultimate to your usb stick or drive, take it with\nyou - and run from (nearly) any computer (even modern Macs). Bring your entire\noperating system, desktop, programs, games, files, personal settings, and much\nmore with you - everywhere! You can now carry your personal operating system in\na pocket!\n\nThis is not bartpe/winpe/livecd or anything similar! This is the first real and\nfull version of Windows 7 Ultimate which can be run on any computer (fast enough\nto run Win7, 512+ Mb RAM, 1+ GHz CPU) from a USB/thumb drive ever created!\n\nInstallation is easy as 1 2 3:\nRequirements: 8GB or bigger high speed (at least 15 MB/s - otherwise Windows 7\nWILL be slow) USB drive or stick\n[Works well on Windows 7/Vista/2008 R2, doesnt work well on XP/2003!]\nIf your are running XP, download and follow THIS GUIDE: http ://ub3r.1337. cx/xp before doing anything else [not required for external USB drives]!\nThe installer *may* not work correctly on XP, its recommended to install from 7/Vista.\n\n1. Extract the archive to a different location than your USB drive (e.g. desktop)\nusing Winrar or 7zip. [DO NOT EXTRACT IT TO THE USB DRIVE!] Make a backup of\nyour USB drive, it will be formatted during the installation.\n2. Right click installer.bat, press Run as administrator and follow the on-screen\ninstructions. (If you are sure that your USB drive is formatted as NTFS with 4k\ncluster size you can use the alternative installer instead.)\n3.a: Insert the USB drive into (any) computer [without any hubs!], (re)start it\nand press F8, F9, F11, F12, option or another key depending on your hardware.\nA menu should appear, choose your USB drive from it. You can also change the\nboot device order in the bios[press ctrl + s, F2, F10 etc.]. Read the motherboard\nmanual or google it. (This method works on computers that can boot from USB.)\n-==OR==-\n3.b: Burn the bootloader to an empty CD [run &quot;burn bootloader.bat&quot;], insert the CD\nand the USB drive to (any) computer, (re)start it and choose &quot;USB&quot; from the menu.\n(This method will work on almost any computer.)\n\nThats it, enjoy carrying a full copy of Win 7 Ultimate in your pocket!\n\n[extra]: 7 Ultimate supports ANY language! In order to change it to your native\nlanguage go to start, type update and press &quot;windows update&quot;. Then click &quot;check for\nupdates&quot;, select the languages you want to install and wait. [I dont recommend\ninstalling any other updates as it may destroy the crack] Finally set the language\nby going to start - control panel - clock language and region - change display\nlanguage. Enjoy using your portable windows in your native language! [Dont forget\nto install your network and display drivers first!]\n\n[Optional:] If your drive is bigger than 8GB you may want to increase the size\nof the virtual system drive of your new Windows in order to gain more disk space:\n1) browse to your usb drive and move the 7USBEditionByiMortaluz.vhd somewhere\nelse (e.g. desktop)\n2) start VHDResizer.exe and select this file\n3) press &quot;save as&quot; and browse to you usb drive again. Call the file\n7USBEditionByiMortaluz [It wont work if you call it something else!] and press\nsave\n4) Choose the size depending on the size of your usb drive and press resize. Get\nyourself a cup of coffee, its going to take long time.\n5) When you boot your new portable windows for the first time - press start\nmenu, type partition and hit enter. Right click 7USBEditionByiMortaluz and\nchoose &quot;extend volume&quot;. Keep pressing next.\n\nRecovery: If your personal portable Windows does no longer boot, you can repair\nit with the included &quot;fix boot.bat&quot; tool.\nIf it doesnt help, copy 7USBEditionByiMortaluz.vhd from your usb drive\nto your desktop, reinstall Win7 USB Edition, copy the 7USBEditionByiMortaluz.vhd\nfile back to the USB drive (replace the existing file). No files will be lost!\n\nYou can mount the virtual system partition from any other Windows 7 installation!\nGo to start, type partition, press &quot;create and format disk partitions&quot;. Press\naction - attach VHD and browse to the 7USBEditionByiMortaluz.vhd file. You can\nthen access (or recover) all your files.\n\nNew in version 2.0:\n-Lots of fixes, a completely new installer, can now be installed to any USB drive!\n\nAdditional info:\nThis is a fully functional and cracked copy of Windows 7 Ultimate x86. I dont\nrecommend updating it with Windows Update, as this can make the crack no longer\nwork, do it at your own risk. Bare in mind that most USB sticks are slower than\ndisks and that performance may suffer.\n\nMD5 Checksum: 7d82eec7b076150cd5aa780c0ffb95fc\n\nIncluded software:\nDriver Genius Professional - quickly find the drivers you need\nChrome Plus [with adblock]- because Internet Explorer sucks...\nSteam - now you can carry all your favorite games with you - everywhere!\nEverest Ultimate - Get advanced information about your hardware\n7zip - a free WinRAR replacement\nuTorrent - never stop downloading and seeding!\nCCleaner - easily free up disk space\n\nIncluded tools:\nWin7logon changer - change your logon background\nUltimate Win7 Tweaker\nProceXP - advanced task manager\nPassRenew - change passwords, add/delete users on any computer that you start\nyour new portable Windows on!\nWingate - start programs without logging on, log on without password (can be\nused for recovery (or evil) purposes)\nGodMode - useful Windows 7 easter egg\n\nApplied tweaks:\nSome services (error reporting, windows defender, etc.) have been disabled in\norder to give you the maximum performace\nWindows Activation is completely removed!
