But that November 1, her life was shattered when her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher, was murdered in their apartment. Five days later, Amanda was taken into custody and charged by the Italian police; her arrest and the subsequent investigation ignited an international media firestorm. Overnight, this ordinary young American student became the subject of intense scrutiny, forced to endure a barrage of innuendo and speculation. Two years later, after an extremely controversial trial, Amanda was convicted and imprisoned. But in 2011 an appeals court overturned her conviction and vacated the charges. Free at last, she immediately returned home to the U.S., where she has remained silent, until now.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d72bc7e6332f6d027fd1fc294b2334d3f6aa9db","amp;dn":"Waiting+to+Be+Heard%3A+A+Memoir+by+Amanda+Knox+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d72bc7e6332f6d027fd1fc294b2334d3f6aa9db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,114,188,126,99,50,246,208,39,253,31,194,148,178,51,77,63,106,169,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
