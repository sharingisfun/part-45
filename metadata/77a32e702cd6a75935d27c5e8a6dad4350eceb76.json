In many\n\tcases, the same solution is provided in all chapters in that section,\n\twith each chapter providing new features to the project from the  \n\tprevious chapter.\n   -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   \t\t\t\tSection 1: Basic Concepts:\n   \t\t\t\t--------------------------\n   \tIn the first section, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll build three simple workflows. In Chapter\n   \t1, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll create a workflow using the workflow designer and some of the \n   \tbasic built-in activities. In Chapter 2, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll re-create the same\n   \tworkflow in code. This will give you an opportunity early on to see \n   \tboth designer workflows and coded workflows. Both types will be \n   \tdemonstrated throughout the book. In Chapter 3, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll use the \n   \tflowchart activity, which provides the ultimate flexibility in \n   \tdesigning complex workflows.\n   -------------------------------------------------------------------------\t\n   \t\t\t\tSection 2: Designing Workflows:\n   \t\t\t\t-------------------------------\n   \tIn the second section, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll build a workflow that computes the cost\n   \tof an order. Each chapter will add additional features to the project \n   \tfrom the previous chapter. The project in Chapter 4 demonstrates how\n   \tto pass data into and out of a workflow. In Chapter 5, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll \n   \tinteractively execute activities based on a\n   \tcollection of objects. Chapter 6 will show you how to handle and throw\n   \texceptions. In Chapter 7, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll explore the two main ways to extend \n   \tthe workflow activities: creating a custom activity and executing the\n   \tInvokeMethod activity.\n   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \t\n\t\t\t\tSection 3: Communication:\n\t\t\t\t-------------------------\n\tIn the third section, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll build workflows that take advantage of the\n\tintegration with the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). The \n\tproject in Chapter 8 builds a console application that communicates\n\twith other instances of the same application using WCF messages. In \n\tChapter 9, the console app is replaced with a Windows Presentation \n\tFoundation (WPF) application, which demonstrates how the application \n\tand workflow can interact with each other. In Chapter 10, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll host\n\ta workflow in a WCF web service. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll also consume that service using \n\ta workflow application.\n   -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\t\t\tSection 4: Workflow Extensions:\n\t\t\t\t-------------------------------\n\tA key component of workflow design is the use of extensions to \t\n\tconfigure the environment in which the workflow activities operate. The \n\tproject in Chapter 11, for instance, demonstrates how to use the\n\tstandard SQL persistence extension. This extension allows the state of \n\tthe workflow to be written to a SQL database and retrieved later, when \n\tthe workflow is resumed. In Chapter 12, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll explore ways to\n\textend and customize the persistence operation. The project in Chapter \n\t13 demonstrates how to track the execution of a workflow in a variety \n\tof ways. In Chapter 14, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll use database transactions to ensure\n\tdata consistency across multiple activities. In Chapter 15, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll \n\texecute the application updates on the same database transaction used \n\tto persist the workflow state. This will guarantee that the workflow \n\tstate and application data stay consistent. Finally, in Chapter 16, \n\tyouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn how to configure extensions when the workflow is \n\tinstantiated by a WorkflowServiceHost.\n   -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   \t\t\t\tSection 5: Advanced Topics:\n   \t\t\t\t---------------------------\n   \tChapter 17 demonstrates how to include logic within the workflow design\n   \tto handle abnormal conditions such as compensation and cancellation. In \n   \tChapter 18, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see how to use both built-in and custom activities \n   \tto support collections of objects. The project in Chapter 19 uses the \n   \tInterop activity to execute workflows and activities that were created \n   \tusing previous versions of WF. In Chapter 20, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll use the Policy \n   \tactivity from version 3.0 in a WF 4.0 workflow.\n   -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77a32e702cd6a75935d27c5e8a6dad4350eceb76","amp;dn":"Beginning+WF+in+.NET+4.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77a32e702cd6a75935d27c5e8a6dad4350eceb76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,163,46,112,44,214,167,89,53,210,124,94,138,109,173,67,80,236,235,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
