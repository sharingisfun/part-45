Conventional wisdom holds that a band two decades into its career can only rehash or reinvent, but with Majesty Shredding, Superchunk has done something entirely different. \n\nNeither a return nor a departure, Majesty Shredding telescopes two decades into 41 indelible, action-packed minutes. It is the sound of youthful exuberance fine-tuned with grown-up confidence. And it may very well be Superchunk's best record yet.\n\nTracks:\n\n-01 digging_for_something\n-02 my_gap_feels_weird\n-03 rosemarie\n-04 crossed_wires\n-05 slow_drip\n-06 fractures_in_plaster\n-07 learned_to_surf\n-08 winter_games\n-09 rope_light\n-10 hot_tubes\n-11 everything_at_once\n\nRemember to seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcfe0a9252cf22c4d864f655a0237718480b4b5f","amp;dn":"Superchunk+-+Majesty+Shredding","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcfe0a9252cf22c4d864f655a0237718480b4b5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,254,10,146,82,207,34,196,216,100,246,85,160,35,119,24,72,11,75,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
