Hellfire expanded on parts of the game people wanted more of the most; a new Monk character class, (several others were also included but not visible without a special file), new enemies, new bosses, new weapons, spells, and more. It gave those tired with beating Diablo a brand new challenge to fight. The Hive was the scene of the new battles. With brand new rare items and new spells, the game of Diablo would never be the same again. \n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n- Pentium-60 \n- 8MB RAM (16MB for Multiplayer) \n- Windows 95 or better \n- SVGA Video Card \n- Microsoft Compatible Mouse \n- Double Speed CD-ROM \n\n\nInstall notes:\n\n1.
