With tempos ranging from 120-129 bpm, these loops have a wide range of applications. Some of the loops are quite funky with an old school feel, while others are strictly quantized electronic beats. A second volume will follow shortly, with more of a techno/trance slant to it. \n\nTorrent contains 3 RAR files with 295 loops\n-------------------------------------------\nChicago Fire House Drums 120-129 (64 loops)\nVEH1 House Beats 128 BPM (86 loops)\nX-Mix Studio Loops 2 Tech+Prog Hse 120-129 BPM (145 loops)\n\nThe X-Mix loops are particularly special, as they appeared on commercial productions you will actually have heard of. Several of the loops were used in remixes by Armand Van Helden. That guy knows his beats, so it&amp;#039;s really cool that his management has made these loops royalty free and re-usable.\n\nAll samples have been normalized and acidized and are 16-bit WAVs at 44.1KHz, looped precisely and containing the approx bpm in the filenames.\n\nThe samples are from CDs produced by Sonic Foundry/Sony, Vengeance and Cakewalk.\n\n--\nArty - &quot;You love me!&quot;\n14th February 2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87c3e56f985984487695dce274d016ef437aa7e4","amp;dn":"ArtyTorrent+Pack+55-House+Drum+Loops+120-129bpm+v1-WAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87c3e56f985984487695dce274d016ef437aa7e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,195,229,111,152,89,132,72,118,149,220,226,116,208,22,239,67,122,167,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
