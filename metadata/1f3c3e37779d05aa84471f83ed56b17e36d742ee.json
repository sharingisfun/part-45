Supervised by Christophe Rezai, they perform Persian and Kurdish folk melodies, Spanish Cantigas and Gregorian Chants.  Alba has been recorded at the ruins of the 1600 year old Ardeshir Babakan Castle, southern Iran.

These guys are not Britany Spears or 50 Cent. They do not have villas in Bel Air, neither do they drive golden Hummers with spinner rims. They are iranian musicians and they really need your money. So, if you like what you hear, please support them and purchase a copy!
