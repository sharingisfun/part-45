With brand new birds, brand\nnew superpowers, and a whole galaxy to explore, the sky is no\nlonger the limit!\n\nInstallation Instructions\n\nTwo choises:\n\n#1 Normal crack (the classic approach you know and love)\n\nInstall\nCopy cracked files (Crack Folder) to installed directory.\nRegister with any key.\nHave fun!\n\n#2\n\nOption 2 is a little different from our usual approach. This\nInjector should work with future updates aswell, but it\nrequires a internet connection (so no firewall) because it\nreads the packets from inside the game and tricks the game\ninto thinking the key is valid.\n\nInstall.\nCopy Injector files (Injector Folder) to installed directory.\nStart game and Ctrl-Tab out.\nStart injector.\nGo back into game, type any serial key.\nGo back into the game, type any serial key and click Register\nto register the game.\nHave fun!\n\nIf you like this game, buy it! :)\n\nErES - Group Information\n\nHere at ErES we consider each member as more than just a collegue or a\nfriend, but as a family member. It's been just over three years since\nErES was established and in that time in the scene we've produced many\nquality releases because of our attitude not only as a group -- but as\nindividuals; each member of the group has shown respect and friendship\nand in return offers loyalty that could only be found when part of a\ntight-knit family. We are not a release machine and never intend to be.\nWe have a relaxed, yet hard-working attitude towards producing releases\nand you can see this through all of our current (and future) releases.\n\nIf you feel ErES is a family that you want to be part of\nwe have listed below the currently open positions and things we\nrequire:\n\nExperienced reversers for all Operating Systems;\nSkilled coders;\nQuality suppliers;\nGood 100Mbit+ EU &amp; Asia Sites to affil with;\nAnything else you think we might like!\n\ne r e s g r p  a t  g m a i l . c o m\n\nascii/nfo:...........ph0!SiLK    updated:............16.04.2010","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22a83acc901bf6650626b75db04d7e8df561e184","amp;dn":"Angry.Birds.Space.v1.2.0.Cracked.GAME.READ.NFO-ErES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22a83acc901bf6650626b75db04d7e8df561e184","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,168,58,204,144,27,246,101,6,38,183,93,176,77,126,141,245,97,225,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
