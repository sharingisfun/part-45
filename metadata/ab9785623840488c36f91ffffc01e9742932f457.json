Recovering at the hospital, she has dreams that shed light on different aspects of her identity - such as the way she deals with the loss of her parents. TRAUMA lets you experience those dreams in an interactive way, reminiscent of Point-and-Click Adventure Games. It builds upon this established formula by introducing a gesture-based interface, real-time 3D technology for dynamic level layouts, unique photographic visuals and a level design philosophy that focuses on creating a rich experience rather than an elaborate puzzle challenge. Combined with the unconventional story, it is aimed to be a compact and deep game for a literate and mature audience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab9785623840488c36f91ffffc01e9742932f457","amp;dn":"TRAUMA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab9785623840488c36f91ffffc01e9742932f457","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,151,133,98,56,64,72,140,54,249,31,255,252,1,233,116,41,50,244,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
