Hailing from Newcastle Upon Tyne, GINHOUSE were a short lived Progressive Rock trio featuring GEOFF SHARKEY (Lead Guitar &amp; Vocals), STEWART BURLINSON (Bass Guitar &amp; Vocals) and DAVE WHITTAKER (Drums). This power trio played a highly imaginative and powerful form of rock, coming to the attention of B&amp;C Records in 1970. The band recorded their only album at Abbey Road studios with producer Anders Henriksson (also producer of the legendary Quatermass). The resulting record featured excellent original compositions such as Tyne God , The Journey , The House and Sun in a Bottle , along with a highly effective reworking of The Beatles And I Love Her . Disbanding soon after the release of their only album, the music of GINHOUSE is now highly sought after by collectors of early 70s Progressive Rock. This Esoteric Recordings release has been newly remastered from the original masters and includes an illustrated booklet and a new essay. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nStewart Burlison (bass guitar, vocals)\nGeoff Sharkey (lead guitar, vocals)\nDavid Whitaker (drums)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:336c5ea73249a6e7e718cb3ae919010b46dc0750","amp;dn":"Ginhouse+-+Ginhouse+%5B1971%5D%5B2013%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"336c5ea73249a6e7e718cb3ae919010b46dc0750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,108,94,167,50,73,166,231,231,24,203,58,233,25,1,11,70,220,7,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
