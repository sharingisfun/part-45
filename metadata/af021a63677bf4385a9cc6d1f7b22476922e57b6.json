Do you believe bananas contain more calories as they ripen and get sweeter? This sequel to the bestselling What Einstein Told His Cook continues Robert L. Wolke's investigations into the science behind our foods. In response to ongoing questions from readers of his nationally syndicated Washington Post column, &quot;Food 101,&quot; Wolke debunks misconceptions with reliable, commonsense logic. And for exceptionally inquisitive cooks and scientists, he offers &quot;Sidebar Science&quot; features, which dig more deeply into the chemical processes that underlie food and cooking. Above all, What Einstein Kept Under His Hat provides indispensable information that will make listeners better shoppers, cooks, and eaters.\n\nWritten by Robert L.
