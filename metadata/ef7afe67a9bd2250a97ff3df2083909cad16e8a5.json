Indian Summer - the phrase itself suggests an acknowledgement of a waning in progress - is something of a companion piece to 2004's Private Brubeck Remembers. Like that gem, Indian Summer is a solo piano work comprised of Brubeck's ruminations on standards of the mid-20th century, the period when he was just coming up as an artist and blossoming as a young man. These are reflective, meditative ballads, softly but skillfully played and hinting at melancholy. On time-worn Americana such as &quot;Georgia on My Mind,&quot; &quot;September Song,&quot; &quot;Sweet Lorraine,&quot; and &quot;Spring Is Here,&quot; Brubeck is restrained but soulful, out to prove nothing. It's not that age has dulled him; Brubeck's performance is uniformly exquisite, imaginative, and elegant; it's just not edgy. A small handful of original material nicely complements the standards, adding up to one of the more intimate entries in Brubeck's enormous discography.  \n\n01. You'll Never Know   \n02.
