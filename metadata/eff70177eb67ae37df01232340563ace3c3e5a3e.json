Always use your finger or the end of a pen to guide your eyes by pointing it under the words you are reading. (This really helps to make you conscious of the speed at which you are reading, which is surprisingly important.)\n\n2. Every day, read something you chose for 10 minutes at your normal speed and mark where you started and finished. Then try reading that exact same passage in 5 minutes. (This will help you get used to reading faster than you would normally be comfortable with.)\n\nPlease forgive me for insulting you Beth. I hope this helps you with the home schooling.\n\nKyle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eff70177eb67ae37df01232340563ace3c3e5a3e","amp;dn":"Math+and+Reading+Software+for+Children+and+Adults","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eff70177eb67ae37df01232340563ace3c3e5a3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,247,1,119,235,103,174,55,223,1,35,35,64,86,58,206,60,62,90,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
