Contained in this collection are the monsters found in its publication span. While not wacky and user-created like the Fiend Factory/Folio monsters, they are rather created and edited by professionals. Their presentation (and paucity) reflects this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3948434847321ab957a017e479a20f590308a4b6","amp;dn":"AD%26amp%3BD+Imagine+Magazine+Monster+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3948434847321ab957a017e479a20f590308a4b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,72,67,72,71,50,26,185,87,160,23,228,121,162,15,89,3,8,164,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
