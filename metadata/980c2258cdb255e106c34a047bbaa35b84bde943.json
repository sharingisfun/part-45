The four played together last February in Las Vegas and have since hit the studio under producer/engineer Andy Johns to record tracks for an upcoming album. \n\n&quot;The style is high-energy, kick-ass rock n' roll,&quot; says Satriani. &quot;We all bring to the table some unusual influences and then we also share a lot of roots. We'll draw from funk, blues and experimental. We know what we want to get out of it. We want passages in songs that develop and we want everyone's personality to be able to come out.&quot; \n\n&quot;I just got back last Wed. from a week and a half of recording with Sam, Joe, and Chad, and all I can say is....F_K, the shit is ROCKIN!!!! NOBODY will be disappointed!&quot; Anthony said of Chickenfoot on his blog. \n\nThey hope to finish recording by January, come up with a name less retarded than Chickenfoot, and release an album in April and follow it up with a tour.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:980c2258cdb255e106c34a047bbaa35b84bde943","amp;dn":"Chickenfoot-Chickenfoot-2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"980c2258cdb255e106c34a047bbaa35b84bde943","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,12,34,88,205,178,85,225,6,195,74,4,123,186,163,91,132,189,233,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
