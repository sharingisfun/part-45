It is usually described as one of TolstoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest novels.\n\n    War and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, age and marriage. While today it is considered a novel, it broke so many novelistic conventions of its day that many critics of TolstoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time did not consider it as such. Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense. (Summary by Wikipedia)\n\n    Note: The novel is split up in 15 books. This is the recording of book one, which covers events in the year 1805. The recording of the next book can be found here.\n\nwww.opencast.de (audiobooks, ebooks ...)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b69d256e8bb09b8b7ce25d5c48c717e977aa7ff3","amp;dn":"Audiobook+-+War+and+Peace+by+Leo+Tolstoy+Book+One+from+1805","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b69d256e8bb09b8b7ce25d5c48c717e977aa7ff3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,157,37,110,139,176,155,139,124,226,93,92,72,199,23,233,119,170,127,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
