From the first moment i \nwas not pleased with the outcome of the project. Quality of the recordings \nwas not right (mainly audio) and some of the DVD's had a lot of problems. \n\nSo, i decided that this needed a REWORK when i could do it. Finaly that \nday arrived and now due to a better way of capturing my old VHS tapes the \noutcome of this is much better.\n\nThe setlist of these reworked versions will be the same but quality will \nbe much higher than the first versions of it. So, drop the old ones and \ngrab these\n\nHope this will please you and gives you much joy has i had putting this \nup. \n\nJust a special word for the band who made all this possible, without them \nand their music this would not be here. Thank you boys.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.deus.be&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.deus.be&lt;/a&gt; go there vist the website and enjoy.\n\nOn http://www.hotellounge.be you can find a new version of the late dEUS \nForum.
