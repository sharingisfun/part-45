Overview\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBopup Communication Server is a secure messaging suite designed to \nprovide efficient and private communication over networks of any size. \nThe server meets most of the critical business needs, such as \ncentralized management, the Active Directory (LDAP) support, message and \nfile transfer logging. It can be easily deployed over the business \ninfrastructure to unite the entire company's offices and other locations \ninto one internal IM workspace with control over messaging groups, user \npermissions to view others and send messages and documents, a message \nand transfer archive with printing support. \n\nSince the server stores and delivers offline messages and files, users \nnever lose information they are supposed to receive. Messaging is \nencrypted with strong algorithms so personal and group conversations are \nsafe and secure even if data is sent via the Internet. Users can send \nmessages with formatted text, links and graphic emoticons (smileys), \norganize their personal Contact Lists, access their contacts from any \nworkplace and see who is online and available for communication. \nThe client software can be configured on the server to run in the \nConfirmation Mode, which means that the client pops up every time a new \nmessage is received and keeps the window on top until the user confirms \nthe message. \n\nTo crown it all, Bopup Communication Server is fast to deploy and easy \nto use. It has a great and flexible user interface and comes with a \nbuilt-in messaging system for scheduled and planned user notifications \nincluding the File Distribution system that offers a managed \ndistributing documents to users. Client instant messengers can be easily \ninstalled and distributed via Group Policies with the support of \npre-installed settings. \n\n\nKey features:\n\n* Secure and Private Communication\nAll transmitted messages and files are encrypted with strong encryption \nalgorithms based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and CAST-128 \nalgorithms. That is the first and primary way to make corporate \nand business IM safe and secure. \n\n* Authentication Modes\nThe server supports various modes to authenticate and authorize \nconnected users. Choose the best way for your corporate and business \ninfrastructure from the available authentication modes: Simple, Windows \nAuthentication (SSPI) and Private login/password.\n\n* Messaging Groups\nThe centralized management of user groups makes it possible to organize \na flexible IM structure with a list of assigned groups and \nsend/receive-only permissions set for each user. \n\n* User Presence Status\nOnline statuses allow users to see the current status of each user in \ntheir Contact List, i.e. Online, Away, Offline/Not available and control \ntheir own status. \n\n* Contact List Access\nUsers can organize personal Contact Lists and access them from any \nworkplace and location. Users are informed if there are new contacts \navailable on the IM server and if they can be added to their Contact \nLists. \n\n* Offline File Transfer and Urgent Messaging\nEnable message exchange and file transfer even if some users are \ncurrently not available. Offline messages and files are automatically \ndelivered by the IM server to the recipient when the latter goes online. \nSend urgent messages for high-priority tasks and notifications. \n\n* File Distribution\nEasy, managed and secure distributing files and directories to client \nworkstations. Important documents can be assigned and delivered to users \nfrom the server in a fully automated mode with a set of advanced flags. \n\n* Terminal Server Support\nThe client software fully supports the Terminal Server, Citrix \nenvironments and the Windows XP Fast User Switching feature. Users can \ncommunicate even if they are connected to the same server via Terminal \nClient sessions or have open logon sessions on the same computer \nsimultaneously. \n\n* Confirmation Mode\nActivate the Confirmation Mode which pops up the client messenger when \na message is received and keeps it on top of other windows until the \nuser clicks the Confirm Message button. That is the best way to attract \nusers' attention. \n\n* Centralized Notification\nSend notifications and urgent messages and keep users updated on any \nevents and information. These messages are automatically delivered by \nthe server at the scheduled time at the specified intervals. \n\n* Message and Transfer Logging &amp; Archiving\nBrowse, search and view the entire message and file transfer archives. \nSave and print information for any period and for any person. \n\n* Instant IM Client Updates\nThe messaging clients can be instantly updated from the central IM \nserver. This feature allows to keep IM client versions up-to-date and \ndeploy new software updates and patches in a completely automated way \nwithout having to manually install it on all user computers.\n\n* Active Directory (LDAP) Support\nImport user accounts from a global catalog and create the local users \ndatabase on the server within a few seconds. Import accounts by choosing \ndifferent criterias: by Organizational Units (OU) or by Groups. \nThe server also provides integration options with a directory and can \nsearch and import accounts &quot;on-the-fly&quot; when new users connect.\n\n* Access from a Command Line Interface\nControl the communication server and send messages directly from \na command line interface. Send scheduled and instant messages to users \nand groups from third-party applications, scripts or batch files.\n\n* Fast to Deploy and Easy to Use\nNeither experience nor special skills are needed for installing the \nserver. Just go through the steps of the Setup Wizard and get your IM \nsystem running in a few minutes. \n\n\n\n2. System Requirements\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBopup Communication Server requires the following minimum system \nconfiguration: \n\n- 1 GHz processor (or higher recommended) \n- 512 MB RAM \n- 70 MB free disk space (*) \n- Microsoft Windows NT 4.0/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/7 (**) \n- Microsoft SQL 2000/2005/2008 Server and higher \n- Active Directory (LDAP) presence (optional)\n- Network connection configured for TCP/IP protocols\n- Internet connection (optional)\n\n* - Specified disk space is required if the product installed with \nbuilt-in SQL server.\n\n** - The built-in MSDE 2000 package that comes with the installation is \nnot supported by Windows Vista and later systems and on that system \nthe communication server should be installed using an existing external \nMicrosoft SQL Server software.\n\n\nBopup Communication Server requires Windows administrator rights to run \nthe Setup Wizard and install the service. After installation the server \ncan be run and managed under a non-administrator Windows account. \n\n\n\n3. Installation Tips\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore the installation, make sure that the TCP/IP protocol is installed \nin your Network Settings. Client computers should be able to access the \nserver computer. If you plan to organize communications via \na WAN/Internet connection, make sure that the server IP address \nis shared and reachable from outside locations. \n\nSince Bopup Communication Server logs and archives all message, file \ntransfer history and user conversations, it needs a database server to \nstore all the data. The server installation file comes in 2 setup \npackages: the first package requires an installed Microsoft SQL server \n(on a local or remote computer) and the second package includes the MSDE \n2000 engine that can be installed together with Bopup Communication \nServer. \n\nDuring the setup of the IM server you can choose from 3 available \ninstallation modes: \n\n- &quot;Install the SQL server on this computer&quot; \nThis is the Local Installation Mode and the most preferred way to \ninstall the IM server. Use it to install MSDE 2000 that comes with the \nsetup package as an internal SQL server on the local computer. \n\n= &quot;Use an existing SQL server&quot;\nThis is the Remote Installation Mode and you should specify an existing \nMicrosoft SQL server running somewhere on a local or remote computer. \nUse this option if you already have an SQL server on your computer or \non the local area network (LAN) of your company. \n\n- &quot;Install the Management Console only&quot;\nThis is the Administration Installation Mode that installs only the \nManagement Console to manage an existing database of Bopup Communication \nServer. Choose this mode if you want to manage Bopup Communication \nServer running somewhere on your network from the local computer (Remote \nAdministrator Console). \n\n\nThe Setup Wizard creates an SQL database on the specified SQL server, \ninstalls and runs the Bopup Communication Server service. The IM server \nis managed via the Management Console (GUI). You can start it either \nusing its desktop shortcut or from the &quot;Bopup Communication Server&quot; \nfolder in the Start menu.\n\n\n\n4.
