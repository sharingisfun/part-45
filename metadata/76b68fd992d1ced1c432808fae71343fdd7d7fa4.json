From alien invasions, to walking trees, to winged beasts in the woods, to dinosaurs spotted in the village of Three Pines, his tales are so extraordinary no one can possibly believe him. Including Armand and Reine-Marie Gamache, who now live in the little Quebec village.\r\n\r\nBut when the boy disappears, the villagers are faced with the possibility that one of his tall tales might have been true.\r\n\r\nAnd so begins a frantic search for the boy and the truth. What they uncover deep in the forest sets off a sequence of events that leads to murder, leads to an old crime, leads to an old betrayal. Leads right to the door of an old poet.\r\n\r\nAnd now it is now, writes Ruth Zardo. And the dark thing is here.\r\n\r\nA monster once visited Three Pines. And put down deep roots. And now, Ruth knows, it is back.\r\n\r\nArmand Gamache, the former head of homicide for the SÃ»retÃ© du QuÃ©bec, must face the possibility that, in not believing the boy, he himself played a terrible part in what happens next.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE SEED**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76b68fd992d1ced1c432808fae71343fdd7d7fa4","amp;dn":"The+Nature+of+the+Beast+-+Louise+Penny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76b68fd992d1ced1c432808fae71343fdd7d7fa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,182,143,217,146,209,206,209,196,50,128,143,174,113,52,63,221,125,127,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
