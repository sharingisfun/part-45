Also known for being John Lennons backing band on Sometime in New York City (probably less known for being Yoko Onos backing band on a record too).\nThis is really good psychedelia, clearly influenced by Frank Zappa and Country Joe and the Fish stoner album Electric Music for Mind and Body.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fd89e3b4a1f7520405e13113ad87780aa5f4b76","amp;dn":"Elephant%5C%27s+Memory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fd89e3b4a1f7520405e13113ad87780aa5f4b76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,216,158,59,74,31,117,32,64,94,19,17,58,216,119,128,170,95,75,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
