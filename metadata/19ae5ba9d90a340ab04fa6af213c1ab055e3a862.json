Is this view correct? In fact, scholar Terry Mortenson has done fascinating original research on this subject in England, and documents that several leading, pre-Darwin scholars and scientists, known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“scriptural geologistsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ did not believe in long ages for the earth. Mortenson sheds light on the following:\n\n- Before Darwin, what did the Church believe about the age of the earth?\n- Why did it believe this way?\n- What was the controversy that rocked the Church in 19th-century England?\n- Who were the Ã¢â‚¬Å“scriptural geologistsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½?\n- What influences did the Church contend with even before DarwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book?\n- What is the stance of the Church today?\n\nThis book is a thoroughly researched work of reference for every library - certainly every creationist library. Terry Mortenson spent much time and work on this project in both the United States and Great Britain. The history of the Church and evolution is fascinating, and it is interesting to see not only the tremendous influence that evolution has had on the Church, but on society as well.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Terry Mortenson with a Ph.D. in the history of geology from the University of Coventry in England and an M.Div. from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Chicago, he has lectured on the creation-evolution controversy in 22 countries since the late 1970s. Much of his M.Div. studies focused on various (Biblical, historical and philosophical) aspects of this subject. His Ph.D. thesis analyzed the origins of old-earth geology in the early 19th century and particularly the writings of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœscriptural geologistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a group of scientists and non-scientists who wrote Biblical, geological and philosophical arguments against these budding old-earth theories.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19ae5ba9d90a340ab04fa6af213c1ab055e3a862","amp;dn":"The+Great+Turning+Point+-+Dr.+Terry+Mortenson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19ae5ba9d90a340ab04fa6af213c1ab055e3a862","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,174,91,169,217,10,52,10,176,79,166,175,33,60,26,176,85,227,168,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
