He and police detective Carol Jordan have put away scores of dangerous criminals and have a clearance rate that colleagues envy or resent. But there is one serial killer who has shaped and defined their careers, a person whose evil surpasses all others: Jacko Vance, an ex-celebrity and sociopath whose brilliance and utter lack of remorse have never left TonyÃ‚â€™s mind in the ten years Vance has been locked up. Now Jacko has broken out of prison and, with a mind even more twisted and cunning than before, he is focused on wreaking revenge on Tony and Carol for the years he has spent in prison. They donÃ‚â€™t know when Jacko will strike, or where. All they know is that he will cause them to feel fear like they've never known.\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d123ef5def89c760deb94607520cbf7854ac8f11","amp;dn":"The+Retribution+-+Val+McDermid%2C+Epub%2C+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d123ef5def89c760deb94607520cbf7854ac8f11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,35,239,93,239,137,199,96,222,185,70,7,82,12,191,120,84,172,143,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
