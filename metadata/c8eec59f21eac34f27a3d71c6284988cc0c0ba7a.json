Originally a street punk band, The Exploited became a faster hardcore punk band with a heavy political influence. Formed in Edinburgh by Stevie Ross and Terry Buchan, who were later joined by ex-soldier Walter (&quot;Wattie&quot;) Buchan (Terry's brother), they signed to Secret Records in March 1981 and released their debut EP Army Life. The album Punks Not Dead followed in the same year. Despite many lineup changes, &quot;Wattie&quot; Buchan has remained as the leader, and the band continued into the 2000s and developed a worldwide following. In 2012 the band started writing material for a new album.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8eec59f21eac34f27a3d71c6284988cc0c0ba7a","amp;dn":"The+Exploited-The+Massacre+1990+..320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8eec59f21eac34f27a3d71c6284988cc0c0ba7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,238,197,159,33,234,195,79,39,163,215,28,98,132,152,140,192,192,186,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
