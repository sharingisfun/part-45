The book will showcase new features in Visual Studio 2010 that ease the creation of applications. Real-world applications will be used throughout to demonstrate the features and ease of use. This book is for professional developers who are working with previous versions of Visual Studio and are looking to make the move to Visual Studio 2010 Professional. The book is not a language primer, a language reference, or a single technology book. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a book that will help professional developers move from previous versions of Visual Studio (starting with 2003 and on up). It will cover the features of Visual Studio 2010 through an application. It will go through a lot of the exciting new language features and new versions of the most popular technologies without putting the emphasis on the technologies themselves. It will instead put the emphasis on how you would get to those new tools and features from Visual Studio 2010. If you are expecting this book to thoroughly cover the new Entity Framework or ASP.NET MVC 2, this is not the book for you. If you want to read a book where the focus is on Visual Studio 2010 and on the reasons for moving to Visual Studio 2010, this is the book for you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c771cdc0c1f0101e4c6cb4cb061a7dbfc7bee299","amp;dn":"Moving+to+Microsoft%28r%29+Visual+Studio%28r%29+2010+-+Pelland%2C+Patrice+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c771cdc0c1f0101e4c6cb4cb061a7dbfc7bee299","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,113,205,192,193,240,16,30,76,108,180,203,6,26,125,191,199,190,226,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
