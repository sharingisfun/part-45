The story of love is hello and goodbye, until we meet again.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Jimi Hendrix)\n\n\nLONNIE SMITH a.k.a. Dr. Lonnie Smith is an American jazz Hammond B-3 organist. Not to be confused with Lonnie Liston Smith.\n\n\n\n2 Cds / Companion pieces:\nCD 1, Lonnie Smith Trio, Foxy Lady: A Tribute To Jimi Hendrix, 1994\nCD 2, Lonnie Smith Trio, Purple Haze: A Tribute To Jimi Hendrix, 1995\n\n\n\nCD 1, Foxy Lady \nThe resurrection of Lonnie Smith continues with this exciting mini-survey of the Jimi Hendrix legacy. This time, the material allows Smith's crackling, tightly knit collaborators, John Abercrombie and Marvin &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith, to run a bit wild, indeed, Abercrombie's tone and attack takes on a Hendrix-like cast on the title track, while Lonnie mostly remains in the same cool soul-jazz frame of mind, an excellent foil. The most ambitious track, &quot;Castles Made of Sand,&quot; takes on a military rhythm before breaking out into Smitty's everywhere-at-once drum patterns, cooking at a fine boil through its 23 1/2-minute length before breaking into a suitably chaotic rendition of &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; toward the end. On the latter, Abercrombie has a ball pouring on the sarcasm, and Lonnie bounces around the organ. &quot;Third Stone from the Sun&quot; moves at a casual, loping pace before Abercrombie and Smitty go into their guitar- and drum-slinger modes. Finally, there is a bit of fantasy in Lonnie's &quot;Jimi Meets Miles&quot;, a musical event that nearly happened, with Abercrombie doing a laconic Hendrix impression over a propulsive rhythm that recalls Miles' Bitches Brew period.\n\nCD 2, Purple Haze \nIn the early '70s, Lonnie Smith's recordings frequently exhibited a debt to Jimi Hendrix's groundbreaking fusions, but he waited until 1995 to release Foxy Lady, a full-fledged tribute to the innovative guitarist. Foxy Lady was so successful that Smith decided to make another Hendrix album, again with John Abercrombie and Marvin &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith. Purple Haze is as entertaining as Foxy Lady, it's truly remarkable to hear how these blues-rockers can open up into soul-jazz numbers tinged with free jazz influences, and confirms not only Hendrix's composing talents, but also Smith's vision.\n\n\n\n2CDs / 1994, 1995 / 320Kbps\n\n\n\nCD 1, Tracklist, Foxy Lady:\n1.
