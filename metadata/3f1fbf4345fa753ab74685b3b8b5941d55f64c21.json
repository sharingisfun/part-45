The History Channel sets out to discover who The Philistines were in this exploratory program, and turns up an interesting mixture of facts and rumors about them. Stories abound about The Philistines epic battles with The Israelites and the various Bible-related tales that spin off from this conflict, but perhaps of most interest is the archaeological evidence of The Philistine's activities which help to put some much-needed physical evidence in place around the fantastic stories. \n\nFile Size ------- 347mb\nLength ---------- 42:54\nResolution ------ 720x480\nContainer ------- avi\nVideo Codec ----- h264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 24\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f1fbf4345fa753ab74685b3b8b5941d55f64c21","amp;dn":"History+Channel%3A+Archenemy%3A+The+Philistines","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f1fbf4345fa753ab74685b3b8b5941d55f64c21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,31,191,67,69,250,117,58,183,70,133,179,184,181,148,29,85,246,76,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
