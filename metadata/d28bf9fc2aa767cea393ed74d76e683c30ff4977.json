The band had been appearing as special guests in support of bands such as Procol Harum, Deep Purple, and Yes, in addition to playing several festivals. Their hard work paid off, and the result is this excellent recording. Recorded live in the studio, PFM proved they were every bit as creative and talented as the U.K. bands of the time. Their symphonic prog rock commingles elements of folk, classical, and jazz in a genuine manner. This is achieved by their transcendent and pliant level of musicianship. &quot;Impressioni di Settembre&quot; and the two-part &quot;Dove...Quando&quot; demonstrate the band's ability to create rich harmonies with pop-like melodies. The band can also lay it down pretty heavy, as can be heard on the rocking &quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã‹â€  Festa,&quot; which turned out to be one of their most requested songs. Storia di un Minuto stands as one of the best progressive rock debuts in history, and along with Per un Amico and Photos of Ghosts, is essential to any serious collection. \n\n.: Cover :. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img71.imageshack.us/img71/8563/pfmstoriadiunminutooj4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img71.imageshack.us/img71/8563/pfmstoriadiunminutooj4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n01.
