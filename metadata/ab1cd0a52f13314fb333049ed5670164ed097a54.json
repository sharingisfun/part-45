Rock and Roll \r\n2. Sick Again \r\n3. Over The Hills and Far Away \r\n4. In My Time of Dying \r\n5. The Song Remains The Same \r\n6. The Rain Song \r\n7. Kashmir \r\n8. No Quarter \r\n9. Trampled Under Foot \r\n10. Moby Dick \r\n11. Dazed and Confused \r\n12. Stairway to Heaven \r\n13. Heartbreaker \r\n\r\nComments: \r\nA mixed performance. In some points the band reaching a peak of their playing, \r\nin other they are just average and rather sloopy. The hardest accent belongs \r\nto the opening numbers, after that the band seems to be a bit tired and that \r\ncaused of lack of soaring during improvisation sections in No Quarter and \r\nDazed And Confused","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab1cd0a52f13314fb333049ed5670164ed097a54","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1975.03.14+San+Diego%2C+California+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab1cd0a52f13314fb333049ed5670164ed097a54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,28,208,165,47,19,49,79,179,51,4,158,213,103,1,100,237,9,122,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
