In order to survive, all creatures, including man, must treat life as a battlefield and master the natural weapons and defences that they have evolved: Tyrannosaurus Rex's 13-inch canines; the geckoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Velcro-like toe pads; the bald eagleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s telescopic vision capable of spotting a hare a mile away.\n\nHow did these attributes, each unique to the organism itself, appear? Certainly not arbitrarily. They evolved for a common reason - to give these animals a critical edge in interspecies warfare, and to ensure the survival of the individualÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s genes into the next generation. To evolve is to survive.\n\nIt doesn't just take willpower to survive. It takes guts, in the form of a digestive system that turns food into fuel. We look closely at the role guts have played in shaping some of Earth's most successful animals: tyrannosaurs, snakes, cows, humans and others.\n\nWe take a 575-million year journey that begins with the planet's first multi-cellular organisms and ends at our dinner tables. Watch as live-action natural history sequences, CGI, epic docudrama, and experimental science help to illustrate our and our fellow species' eternal struggle for survival on earth. \n\n\n\n\nProducers:  Kurt Tondorf &amp; Kate Walker\n--------------------------------------\n\nNarrator:  Gareth Armstrong\n---------------------------\n\n\nTitle: Evolve-Guts\nYear:  2008\nFile Size: 349 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:44:56\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1063 kbit/s\nFPS:  25.000000\nAudio Bitrate: 122 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (N/A)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1283572/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1283572/&lt;/a&gt;  \n \n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:  Ok people we are back to normal.All images can be seen as usual\n-------------\n             \n \n              \n\n\nFor father information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n*** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98d9d43abce44d4fa81269005872228934613be8","amp;dn":"Evolve-Guts-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98d9d43abce44d4fa81269005872228934613be8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,217,212,58,188,228,77,79,168,18,105,0,88,114,34,137,52,97,59,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
