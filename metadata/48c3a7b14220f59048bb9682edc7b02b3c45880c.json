I'm not generally a big fan of super-happy Power Metal, though I do make exceptions, and despite a sound that, on paper, looks horrible; Aquaria have produced a sophomore album that is generally enjoyable, and in places, absolutely brilliant.\n\nThis is South American sympho-prog/Power Metal that draws a lot on bands like Angra or Pagan's Mind, with crystal-clear production, smooth vocals melodies, and some impressive musicianship. That alone isn't enough to lift this above the general sea of similar bands, and indeed, a lot of this album is decent but overly familiar, from the Domine-esque &quot;Child Of The Universe&quot; through the sickly-sweet &quot;Heart Of The Gods&quot;. &quot;Firewings is pretty laughable, as it is the &quot;Hyborean&quot; theme from the Conan score reworked into a power ballad. All of this is competent, but not really arresting.\n\nBut on several tracks - &quot;Expedition&quot;, the title track, and the nine-minute showstopper &quot;Into The Forest&quot; - Aquaria strike out into new territory, and the results are both original and rather amazing. On these songs they have included traditional South American folk-dance melodies and instrumentation to create a hybrid sound somewhere between Anubis Gate and the Native Flute Ensemble. Highlighted by powerful vocals and catchy melodies, these tracks really stand out, especially &quot;Into The Forest&quot; with its tour-de-force composition and searing vocals combined with Samba/Mideast dance rhythms. I know how that sounds, but it works. It really does. It's pretty fruity, but I can't lie and say I don't really like it when I do.&quot;\n--- Sargon the Terrible, November 18, 2007","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48c3a7b14220f59048bb9682edc7b02b3c45880c","amp;dn":"Aquaria+-+Shambala+%5B2007%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48c3a7b14220f59048bb9682edc7b02b3c45880c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,195,167,177,66,32,245,144,72,187,150,130,237,199,176,43,60,69,136,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
