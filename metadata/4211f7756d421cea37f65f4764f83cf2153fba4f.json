SANTANA  -  Dirty Dancin (2002) \n           SANTANA ft CHAD KROEGER  -  Into The Night  (2007)\n\n\n\n\n      &quot;Maria Maria&quot; is a song by Santana featuring The Product G&amp;B.It reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on April 8, 2000, and stayed there for ten weeks. At the 2000 Grammy Awards, the song won the Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Despite other lead singers from the album receiving awards, The Product G&amp;B were, for some reason, not honored with a Grammy. \nIn 2008, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Hot 100 chart, Billboard compiled its list of the top 100 songs since the inception of the chart in various categories. &quot;Maria Maria&quot; came in at #96 on the list of the Billboard: All-Time Hot 100 Top Songs, and #2 on the list of Top Billboard Hot 100 Latin Songs of All Time. Later, it was named the 14th most successful song from 2000 to 2009, on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade.\n\n     &quot;Smooth&quot; is a collaboration between Latin rock band Santana and Rob Thomas of the rock group Matchbox Twenty. The song was written by Thomas and Itaal Shur, sung by Thomas, produced by Matt Serletic and won three Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. It was also the final number-one Hot 100 hit of the 1990s.\n\n     &quot;Put Your Lights On&quot; is a single performed by Santana and Everlast on Santana's album, Supernatural (1999). It barely charted on the US pop chart, reaching #18 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, but did considerably better on rock radio, peaking at #8 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Put Your Lights On&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 2000 Grammy Awards.\n\n     Into the Night&quot; is the first single from Santana's 2007 compilation album, Ultimate Santana. The track features Chad Kroeger from Nickelback. It has received a considerable amount of airplay on VH1. Dania Ramirez of Heroes stars in the music video. The song has peaked at #26 in the United States of America and #4 in Australia.The music video features a man (Freddy Rodriguez of Ugly Betty and Six Feet Under) about to jump off a roof when he sees a girl (Dania Ramirez of Heroes) dancing. He falls for her immediately and starts to follow her. Eventually he follows her to a club where he watches her dance, and at the end they dance together. Meanwhile, Kroeger and Santana play on the roof of the building. The video seems to integrate both the Hispanic and North American cultures, as a symbol of the two cultures coming together in the song itself.\n         ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4211f7756d421cea37f65f4764f83cf2153fba4f","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+527","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4211f7756d421cea37f65f4764f83cf2153fba4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,17,247,117,109,66,28,234,55,246,95,71,100,248,60,242,21,63,186,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
