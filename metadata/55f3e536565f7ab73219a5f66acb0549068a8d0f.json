Jones having been an arranger and conductor at Nicole and Eddie Barclay's record company in Paris when Sinatra courted his services. Held on June 14th at the request of Princess Grace, proceeds from the event benefited the United Nations Fund for Refugee Children. Noel Coward served as master of ceremonies for what was Sinatra's first concert in Europe since 1953. \nGet Rhythm's CD release draws from the Italian radio broadcast of the concert and isn't of a quality comparable with shows from the era that were professionally recorded and intended for commercial release. However, it's more than listenable, with the orchestra and Sinatra audible and clear.\nThis remains the most complete representation of a brilliant show recorded during a rich period for Frank Sinatra.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55f3e536565f7ab73219a5f66acb0549068a8d0f","amp;dn":"Frank+Sinatra+-+Live+At+Monte+Carlo+%5B+Flac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55f3e536565f7ab73219a5f66acb0549068a8d0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,243,229,54,86,95,122,183,50,25,165,246,106,203,5,73,6,138,141,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
