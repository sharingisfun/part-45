He ends with an impassioned plea for the widespread return of the fig leaf to redeem modern art from cheap sensation and innuendo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fb2018a15bdf1476f3b886da68421fefeb77335","amp;dn":"Fig.Leaf.The.Biggest.Cover.Up.in.History.EN.SUB.x264.WEBRIP.MPup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fb2018a15bdf1476f3b886da68421fefeb77335","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,178,1,138,21,189,241,71,111,59,136,109,166,132,33,254,254,183,115,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
