It was a real shock; it shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have been there. The Tudors believed that heaven, where God lived, was perfect and unchanging, and the appearance of this bright new star completely undermined their whole system of belief. \n\nBut there was worse, that observation wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just quietly recorded it rapidly became common knowledge thanks to a really dangerous piece of high technology, the printing press. News of that star was just one of a load of ideas that were going to turn the Tudor world upside-down.\n    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Adam Hart-Davis\n\n\nHart-Davis travels around Britain to introduce the idea and inventions of the Tudor Age in science, literature and education.\n\n\n* The first printing press, like the one recreated at St Bride Printing Library, was brought to England by William Caxton.\n\n* The resulting printing revolution included William TyndaleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s English bible that lead to the standardisation of the English language.\n\n* State education was founded by Henry VIII providing opportunities for Christopher Marlowe and William Harvey amongst others.\n\n* Human anatomy was revolutionised by Andreas Vesalius following the legalisation of human dissection by Henry VIII.\n\n* Modern medicine began from the Swiss Alchemist ParacelsusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ belief that minerals and chemicals could be used to treat diseases.\n\n* Observational science came of age when Thomas Diggs recorded the first observation of a supernova.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e4d5383ca9b697adda5764add6ae805392d4f89","amp;dn":"What+the+Tudors+Did+for+Us++%28BBC+-+Part+2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e4d5383ca9b697adda5764add6ae805392d4f89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,77,83,131,202,155,105,122,221,165,118,74,221,106,232,5,57,45,79,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
