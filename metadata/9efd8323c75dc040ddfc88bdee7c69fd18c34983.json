The Prince of Verona intervenes and declares that further breach of the peace will be punishable by death. Later, Count Paris talks to Lord Capulet about marrying his daughter, but Capulet is wary of the request because Juliet is only thirteen. Capulet asks Paris to wait another two years and invites him to attend a planned Capulet ball. Lady Capulet and JulietÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nurse try to persuade Juliet to accept ParisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ courtship.\nMeanwhile, at the house of Montague, Benvolio talks with his cousin Romeo, Lord MontagueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son, about RomeoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent depression. Benvolio discovers that it stems from unrequited infatuation for a girl named Rosaline, one of Lord CapuletÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nieces. Persuaded by Benvolio and Mercutio, Romeo attends the ball at the Capulet house in hopes of meeting Rosaline. However, Romeo instead meets and falls in love with Juliet. After the ball, in what is now called the Ã¢â‚¬Å“balcony sceneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Romeo sneaks into the Capulet courtyard and overhears Juliet on her balcony vowing her love to him in spite of her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hatred of the Montagues. Romeo makes himself known to her and they agree to be married. With the help of Friar Laurence, who hopes to reconcile the two families through their childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s union, they are secretly married the next day.\nJulietÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cousin Tybalt, incensed that Romeo had sneaked into the Capulet ball, challenges him to a duel. Romeo, now considering Tybalt his kinsman, refuses to fight. Mercutio is offended by TybaltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s insolence, as well as RomeoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“vile submissionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½,[4] and accepts the duel on RomeoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behalf. Mercutio is fatally wounded when Romeo attempts to break up the fight. Grief-stricken and wracked with guilt, Romeo confronts and slays Tybalt.\n\nMontague argues that Romeo has justly executed Tybalt for the murder of Mercutio. The Prince, now having lost a kinsman in the warring familiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ feud, exiles Romeo from Verona and declares that if Romeo returns, Ã¢â‚¬Å“that hour is his lastÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Romeo secretly spends the night in JulietÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chamber, where they consummate their marriage. Lord Capulet, misinterpreting JulietÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grief, agrees to marry her to Count Paris and threatens to disown her when she refuses to become ParisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“joyful brideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. When she then pleads for the marriage to be delayed, her mother rejects her.\nJuliet visits Friar Laurence for help, and he offers her a drug that will put her into a death-like coma for Ã¢â‚¬Å“two and forty hoursÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.[5] The Friar promises to send a messenger to inform Romeo of the plan, so that he can rejoin her when she awakens. On the night before the wedding, she takes the drug and, when discovered apparently dead, she is laid in the family crypt.\nThe messenger, however, does not reach Romeo and, instead, he learns of JulietÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apparent death from his servant Balthasar. Heartbroken, Romeo buys poison from an apothecary and goes to the Capulet crypt. He encounters Paris who has come to mourn Juliet privately. Believing Romeo to be a vandal, Paris confronts him and, in the ensuing battle, Romeo kills Paris. Still believing Juliet to be dead, he drinks the poison. Juliet then awakens and, finding Romeo dead, stabs herself with his dagger. The feuding families and the Prince meet at the tomb to find all three dead. Friar Laurence recounts the story of the two Ã¢â‚¬Å“star-crossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d loversÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The families are reconciled by their childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deaths and agree to end their violent feud. The play ends with the PrinceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elegy for the lovers: Ã¢â‚¬Å“For never was a story of more woe / Than this of Juliet and her Romeo\n\nDVD5, iso image.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9efd8323c75dc040ddfc88bdee7c69fd18c34983","amp;dn":"Prokofiev+Romeo+et+Juliette+Nureyev+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9efd8323c75dc040ddfc88bdee7c69fd18c34983","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,253,131,35,199,93,192,64,221,252,136,189,238,124,105,253,24,195,73,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
