One of the most notorious of those films, BLACULA was the tale of a black vampire who terrorized his victims to an outrageously funky score. This reissue of the 1972 film's soundtrack, composed and conducted by Gene Page, makes a case for itself as one of the great neglected pieces of funk history. Certainly Page's mix of funky instrumentals, complete with wah-wah guitar and horn stabs, and soulful vocal tunes, was inspired by its more mainstream contemporaries, but it bears a decidedly unique character. You don't have to be a kitsch hound to fall prey to BLACULA's seductive charms.&quot;/Allmusic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2366219bbbdd2d3df6eef4cc6fa7b5597fbdacb4","amp;dn":"Soundtrack+-+Blacula+%281972%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2366219bbbdd2d3df6eef4cc6fa7b5597fbdacb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,102,33,155,187,221,45,61,246,238,244,204,111,167,181,89,127,189,172,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
