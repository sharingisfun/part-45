It is Def Leppard's only number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 to date.\n\nThe title &quot;Love Bites&quot; was originally used for a very different song that was eventually re-titled &quot;I Wanna Be Your Hero&quot;, and which appeared as a Hysteria B-side and later on the album Retro Active.\n\nFollowing the huge momentum generated by &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot;, the song was released in August of 1988 and quickly shot to the top of the U.S. charts, dethroning Bobby McFerrin's &quot;Don't Worry Be Happy&quot;. It stayed there for one week before giving up the position to UB40's &quot;Red Red Wine&quot;. The song also hit number eleven in the UK (their second best showing from the album).\n\n&quot;Love Bites&quot; was ranked #8 on the list of &quot;VH1's 25 Greatest Power Ballads&quot; and #52 on the list of &quot;VH1's 100 Greatest Love Songs&quot;.\n\nHysteria is one of only a handful of albums (and the third in rock history) that has charted seven singles or more on the US Hot 100: &quot;Women&quot; (#80), &quot;Animal&quot; (#19), &quot;Hysteria&quot; (#10), &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot; (#2), &quot;Love Bites&quot; (#1), &quot;Armageddon It&quot; (#3), and &quot;Rocket&quot; (#12). It remained on the charts for three years and has sold 18 million copies worldwide.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bc9f5698d7b32683f954b28f763cab0041a8c9a","amp;dn":"Def+Leppard+-+Love+Bites","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bc9f5698d7b32683f954b28f763cab0041a8c9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,201,245,105,141,123,50,104,63,149,75,40,247,99,202,176,4,26,140,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
