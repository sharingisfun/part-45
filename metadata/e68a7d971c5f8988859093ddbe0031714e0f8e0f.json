The late '70s? Yes, the one-word answer is disco. It's 1979, and loose-limbed club-goers are finding nirvana on the glitter-ball stairway to the stars, while the disgruntled rock faithful are working out some homophobic tendencies with &quot;disco sucks&quot; epithets. And Rhino, for its part, has excavated the soundtrack via this 1979 edition of its Billboard Top Hits series. With spandex rockers and new wave chart-toppers still in the wings, disco anthems like Donna Summer's &quot;Hot Stuff/Bad Girls&quot; and Anita Ward's &quot;Ring My Bell&quot; put a stranglehold on the airwaves as Gloria Gaynor's &quot;I Will Survive&quot; became a mantra for women and gay men alike. And let's not forget relatively low-profile sides like Patrick Hernandez's proto-Frankie Goes to Hollywood number &quot;Born to be Alive&quot; and some noble attempts by Diana Ross and Deniece Williams. So, fill that floor and leave your stadium rock jones behind. \n\n\n1. Born To Be Alive - Patrick Hernandez\n2. Contact - Edwin Starr\n3. Come To Me - France Joli\n4. Ring My Bell - Anita Ward\n5.
