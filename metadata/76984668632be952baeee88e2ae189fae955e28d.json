The initial protagonists are four soldiers who have spent the last decade in a bunker at a Russian military base where they were stationed. What greets the survivors initially is a barren world, inhabited now by only bears and wolves. The group's travels eventually bring them into contact with civilization: a world ruled by a collection of gangs.\n\n\n\nThe game works in xp no problem, but I didn't have a chance to test it in Vista so no promises there. Somebody post if you find out one way or the other! \n\nPretty straight forward mount cd image, install, update with patch, copy crack into folder, and Play.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76984668632be952baeee88e2ae189fae955e28d","amp;dn":"Soldiers+of+Anarchy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76984668632be952baeee88e2ae189fae955e28d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,152,70,104,99,43,233,82,186,238,232,142,42,225,137,250,233,85,226,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
