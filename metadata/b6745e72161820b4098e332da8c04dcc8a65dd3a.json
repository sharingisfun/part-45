Twelve years after what appeared to be their final swansong, KinneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rebuilt DrivinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ CryinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢[/size], abandoning his stalled solo career and reclaiming the branding that anticipated a new surge of Southern sensibilities, affirmed by the likes of the Drive By Truckers and Kings of Leon. If Kinney and company questioned how theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d retrofit themselves with this renewed regimen, they betray no doubt here. Offering up a decidedly determined set of withering, wailing rockers tackling a modern malaise of downsized jobs, failed promises and the disintegration of the American dream, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re as brash and defiant as ever, as gloriously insurgent as any band half their age.\n\nIn effect, 'Great American Bubble Factory' serves as a road map for weathering the storm, and with anthemic outbursts like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDetroit City,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the title track, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Stand TallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPreapproved, PredeniedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Hardest Part,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s enough indictment to go around. Still, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the good-natured ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t You Know ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the rousing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGet Around KidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that show DrivinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ CryinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ remains both soaring and sublime.\n\nCredits:\n\nBanjo: Jeff Mosier\nBass, Mandolin, Backing Vocals: Tim Nielsen\nDrums, Percussion, Backing Vocals: Dave V.
