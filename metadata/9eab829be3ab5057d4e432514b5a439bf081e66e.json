Shot in the final months of World War II, Unter den BrÃƒÂ¼cken feels like a movie out of time. If no one told you, there'd be no way of \n\nknowing that Allied forces were already occupying Aachen and flying nightly raids over Berlin, that the Red Army was advancing through Eastern \n\nPrussia. In the relaxed world of Unter den BrÃƒÂ¼cken, there's no war and no Final Solution, just a Havel barge named Liselotte and its joint owners, \n\nHendrik (Carl Raddatz) and Willy (Gustav Knuth).&quot;\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n\nVIDEO\nI have worked to find and use the &quot;best&quot; avisynth technology on the DVD source, and applied the strongest denoising/sharpening that wouldn't remove \n\nany noticable precision (and obv. thanx to high quality x264 encoding not loose anything noticeable there too).\nThe source is HD DVB-T, 1920p, also the TV logo wasn't broadcasted! Very few and almost unnoticable imperfections because of the reception, they \n\nshould not be a concern.\n\nDuration                         : 1h 35mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 336 Kbps\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nBit rate                         : 2 162 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 14.0 Mbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 720 pixels\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\n\nAUDIO\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP2\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\n\nSUBTITLES\nEnglish\nFrench (idx, dÃƒÂ©solÃƒÂ©, la feigne de le passer ÃƒÂ  l'OCR..)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9eab829be3ab5057d4e432514b5a439bf081e66e","amp;dn":"Unter+den+Br%26uuml%3Bcken-1946-HDTV-720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9eab829be3ab5057d4e432514b5a439bf081e66e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,171,130,155,227,171,80,87,212,228,50,81,75,90,67,155,240,129,230,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
