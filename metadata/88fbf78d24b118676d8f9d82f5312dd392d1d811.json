The expedition tested a hypothesis of whether Pacific Islands could have been colonized from Americas, and thus wanted to demonstrate that waterways were not barriers but a means of transportation and gene flow for human populations.\r\n\r\nPeopling of the Pacific is a fascinating story. The Polynesians were without question the greatest open ocean voyagers in human history. They built double-hulled canoes and traveled over the vast expanses of the Pacific settling both Hawaii and New Zealand. Finally, between 700 AD and 900 AD, they reached to Rapa Nui - Easter Island - which was possibly the last place on earth to be permanently settled. The Kon-Tiki expedition tried to open a new window to our understanding of this, one of the last chapters of human colonization of the planet.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x544, 29.969 fps, 2000 Kbps, 00h58m21s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 138 kbps\r\nAudio: AAC, 44100 Hz, stereo\r\n\r\nDVDRip, broadcast version, DUAL Audio Tracks English and Russian, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/nk3itwd03/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/yp10v8nk9/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/8koazuybt/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/b0q4dpgeh/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/6dfgy73nt/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88fbf78d24b118676d8f9d82f5312dd392d1d811","amp;dn":"Kon-Tiki+%281950+-+Norway%2C+Sweden%29+Thor+Heyerdahl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88fbf78d24b118676d8f9d82f5312dd392d1d811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,251,247,141,36,177,24,103,109,143,157,130,245,49,45,211,146,209,216,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
