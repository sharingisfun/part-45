While the strip began as a gag-based series in which the three main protagonists (Torg, Riff and Zoe) would stumble from one brief, bizarre, parody-centric adventure to the next, the characters and plotlines have gradually become longer and more serious. However, even the more dramatic and soap operatic story arcs often conform to the common gag comic strip format.\n\nThis torrent collects 17 years of &quot;Sluggy Freelance&quot; comics, from the strip's beginning in August 1997 to the end of chapter 66 in March 2015.  The first 14 CBR files in the set correspond to the 14 published volumes of the comic (containing chapters 1 through 47), but they are NOT scans of the books; all the comics in this torrent were downloaded directly from the sluggy.com Web site","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71b736ecac9ee3eb168ce0f6d7b4ac19c9da69f3","amp;dn":"Sluggy+Freelance+-+Complete+through+March+2015+%7BWebComixFan%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71b736ecac9ee3eb168ce0f6d7b4ac19c9da69f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,183,54,236,172,158,227,235,22,140,224,246,215,180,172,25,201,218,105,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
