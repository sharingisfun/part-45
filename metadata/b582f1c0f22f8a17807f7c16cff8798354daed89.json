That was the question posed by the government's Office Of National Emergency. Their answer? Create their own super-team, a team the O.N.E. agency can control. And so, the Sentinel Squad program was initiated, where the 80-foot-tall mutant-hunting robots known as the Sentinels would be redesigned and rebuilt for this explicit purpose. But this time around, the Sentinels would be equipped with human pilots.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b582f1c0f22f8a17807f7c16cff8798354daed89","amp;dn":"Sentinel+Squad+ONE+%2801+-+06%29+%282006%29+%28DarthScanner-DCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b582f1c0f22f8a17807f7c16cff8798354daed89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,130,241,192,242,47,138,23,128,127,124,22,207,248,121,131,84,218,237,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
