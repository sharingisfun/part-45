They face a human threat in the form of the mysterious Professor Jaggat and the cold-hearted Kemp. Jaggat and Kemp are fundamentalist Christians who have discovered the existence of vampires, werewolves and ghosts - and are determined to destroy them or carry out brutal experiments upon them. They believe that vampires are the Devil incarnate and must be destroyed; that werewolves contain an evil gene that can be removed by violent scientific experiments; and that ghosts must be forced over to the other side whether they like it or not.\n\nAnnie thinks she has met the man of her dreams in Saul, but something terrible in Saul's past is about to begin haunting him. Mitchell is visited by an old friend in trouble, while George and Nina's relationship is under increasing strain.\n\nVideo\nLength: 1 hour\nFrame width/height: 832x468\nData rate: 1402kbps\nTotal bitrate: 1527kbps\nFrame rate: 25 frames/second\n\nAudio\nBitrate: 125kbps\nChannels: 2 (stereo)\nAudio sample rate: 48 kHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aac76d188ec5e69a29e9ddc31d5e8e3f7eb36815","amp;dn":"Being+Human+2x02+HDTV+H.264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aac76d188ec5e69a29e9ddc31d5e8e3f7eb36815","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,199,109,24,142,197,230,154,41,233,221,195,29,94,142,63,126,179,104,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
