Though often portrayed by the American media as a pale reflection of the United States, Canada, as displayed here, has a truly complex and intricate image. The political struggles of the past and present and the clash over issues of ethnicity, race, religion, language, and culture are just some of the details that mark this country's unmatched uniqueness. From the earliest contact between Amerindians and Europeans to the early 21st century, this history draws the reader into the drama that is Canada.
