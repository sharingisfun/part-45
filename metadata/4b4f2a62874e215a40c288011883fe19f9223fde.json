But she's never faced off against her own kind . . . until now.\n\nDenounced and shunned for dealing with demons and black magic, her best hope is life imprisonmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½her worst, a forced lobotomy and genetic slavery. Only her enemies are strong enough to help her win her freedom. But trust comes hard when it hinges on the unscrupulous tycoon Trent Kalamack, the demon Algaliarept, and a lowlife ex-boyfriend-turned-thief.
