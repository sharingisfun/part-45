One moonlit night, LAPD veteran Dana Vaughn and &quot;Hollywood &quot; Nate Weiss, a struggling-actor-turned cop, get a call about a young man who's been attacking women. Meanwhile, two surfer cops known as Flotsam and Jetsam keep bumping into an odd, suspicious duo--a smooth-talking player in dreads and a crazy-eyed, tattooed biker. No one suspects that all three dubious characters might be involved in something bigger, more high-tech, and much more illegal. After a dizzying series of twists, turns, and chases, the cops will find they've stumbled upon a complex web of crime where even the criminals can't be sure who's conning whom. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:456154fa32e362df67ecc336122b54e9a320f830","amp;dn":"+Hollywood+Moon+by+Joseph+Wambaugh+%28Hollywood+Station+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"456154fa32e362df67ecc336122b54e9a320f830","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,97,84,250,50,227,98,223,103,236,195,54,18,43,84,233,163,32,248,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
