And yet the longer he waits, the more he thinks he's losing his mind, if not his cool. A brutal, bloody and stylish noir story of a professional assassin lost in a world without a moral compass, this is a case study of a man alone, armed to the teeth and slowly losing his mind.\n\nWritten by Matz and illustrated by Luc Jacamon.  Originally published in French as Le Tueur, translated by Archaia Studio Press.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:758ec9e3e79418095d9449cc03e0785afd6b01cb","amp;dn":"The+Killer+%28Archaia+Studio+Press%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"758ec9e3e79418095d9449cc03e0785afd6b01cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,142,201,227,231,148,24,9,93,148,73,204,3,224,120,90,253,107,1,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
