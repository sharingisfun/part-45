This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey tells how the Bee Gees gave away what might have been a number one song so another band could have a hit single.\n\n&quot;Baby, Come To Me&quot; by Patti Austin &amp; James Ingram was on the hot 100 once before earlier in the year. It never made it into the top 40. But after it was featured on General Hospital it came back on the chart and is now at number 31.\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;What recording act charting in the rock era has had the longest name?&quot; Casey says this band of fighting men wore kilts and had a hit with a Christian hymn.\n\nCasey recounts the story of how Lou Rawls was once in a terrible car accident and suffered from total amnesia.\n\nThere is a duet in this countdown by two artists who - between them - have appeared on 35 number one records. That breaks a record set just 6 months earlier by Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney.\n\nLW#3: Heart Attack - Olivia Newton-John\nLW#2: Gloria - Laura Brannigan\nLW#1: Truly - Lionel Richie\n40:    Let's Go Dancin' - Kool &amp; The Gang\n39:    Shock The Monkey - Peter Gabriel\n38:    You Got Lucky - Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers        \n37:    What About Me - Moving Pictures     \n36:    A Penny For Your Thoughts - Tavares     \n35:    Everybody Wants You - Billy Squier    \n34:    The Other Guy - Little River Band\n33:    Hand To Hold On To - John Cougar\n32:    On The Wings Of Love - Jeffrey Osborne\n31:    Baby, Come To Me - Patti Austin &amp; James Ingram\n30:    I'm So Excited - The Pointer Sisters\n29:    Be My Lady - Jefferson Starship\nLDD: We've Only Just Begun - The Carpenters    \n28:    You Can't Hurry Love - Phil Collins\n27:    Africa - Toto\n26:    I.G.Y.
