The benefits of biofuels over traditional petroleum fuels include greater energy security, reduced environmental impact, foreign exchange savings, and socioeconomic issues related to the rural sector. The most common biofuels are produced from classic food crops that require high-quality agricultural land for growth. However, bioethanol can be produced from plentiful, domestic, cellulosic biomass resources such as herbaceous and woody plants, agricultural and forestry residues, and a large portion of municipal and industrial solid waste streams. There is also a growing interest in the use of vegetable oils for making biodiesel. â€œBiofuels: Securing the Planetâ€™s Future Energy Needsâ€ discusses the production of transportation fuels from biomass (such as wood, straw and even household waste) by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The book is an important text for students and researchers in energy engineering, as well as professional fuel engineers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0dc2dacbf40c4d90c7d268773c3e50e02ed4358","amp;dn":"Biofuels+-+Securing+the+Planet%26rsquo%3Bs+Future+Energy+Needs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0dc2dacbf40c4d90c7d268773c3e50e02ed4358","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,220,45,172,191,64,196,217,12,125,38,135,115,195,229,14,2,237,67,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
