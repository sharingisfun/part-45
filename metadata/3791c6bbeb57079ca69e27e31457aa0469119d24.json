Sherrod Brown, D-OH, took the Senate floor Thursday to argue against Wall Street mega-banks that have been deemed Ã¢â‚¬Å“too big to failÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and thus receive the implicit backing of the federal government, arguing that lawmakers should act immediately to break up the big banks. We'll talk about it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3791c6bbeb57079ca69e27e31457aa0469119d24","amp;dn":"Ed+Schultz+Show+-+March+01+2013+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3791c6bbeb57079ca69e27e31457aa0469119d24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,145,198,187,235,87,7,156,166,158,39,227,20,87,170,4,105,17,157,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
