The reader can no longer be enter-\ntained with the simple match-trick or coin puzzles, neither does\nhe want to see problems purely mathematical in nature, such as\ncan be found in any textbook. We have tried to produce a book of\nthose puzzles which lie between the two extremes.\n\nAlthough most of the problems can be solved by logic and\ncommon sense, some of them may also be solved more elegantly\nby mathematics.\n\nThe essential ingredients of a good puzzle are not hard to\nestablish. It should be ingenious but clear, complete yet concise,\nif possible amusing, and have a unique solution. It is for oUr\nreaders to decide how many of these puzzles bear comparison\nwith this ideal.\n\nCompletely new ideas for puzzles are unfortunately rare and\nso we do not apologise for including a few of the &quot;Aged but not\ninfirm&quot;. Many of the problems are original and we claim to have\nimproved others.\n\n\nnjoy and seed back!!!!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff1370bb8a28e4d76287b347d87f16dd2d0f8f19","amp;dn":"Mathematical+Puzzles+for+the+Connoisseur%5BSir.Fun%5D%7C%7CPDF+file","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff1370bb8a28e4d76287b347d87f16dd2d0f8f19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,19,112,187,138,40,228,215,98,135,179,71,216,127,22,221,45,15,143,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
