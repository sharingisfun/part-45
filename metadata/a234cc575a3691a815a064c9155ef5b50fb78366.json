Aware of his skill as a long-range sniper, Kane is recruited by Marcus Mitchell (Adrian Holmes) of the CIA to come back as an operative. In return, Marcus promises that the CIA will provide information to Kane about who put out the hit on his SIU team. Kane is given a long-term off-the-grid mission to take out a high level target that the CIA cannot go after in the traditional way. Marcus feeds Kane intel that leads him into the targets circle with a goal of getting Kane close enough to take a kill shot from a distance. Only then will the identity of the target be revealed to the team. For this operation, Kane recruits three agents to form a new team of operatives. All three are trained by Kane and ultimately driven (like Kane) by not just business, but also for personal reasons.\n\nGenre: Action | Crime | Drama | Thriller\nIMDB Rating: 5.5/10 from 11 users\nDirected by: Lauro Chartrand\nStarring: Steven Seagal, Sarah Lind, Lochlyn Munro\n\nRelease Name: True.Justice.Dead.Drop.2012.DVDRip.XviD-3LT0N\nSize: 700 MB\nVideo: AVi | 640Ãƒâ€”352 | 945 Kbps\nAudio: English | MP3 | 128 Kbps\nRuntime: 01:30:22\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/nHpw1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/nHpw1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/eTQw1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/eTQw1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/5gcKu.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/5gcKu.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/ai28t.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/ai28t.png&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a234cc575a3691a815a064c9155ef5b50fb78366","amp;dn":"True+Justice+Dead+Drop+2012+DVDRip+XviD-3LT0N","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a234cc575a3691a815a064c9155ef5b50fb78366","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,52,204,87,90,54,145,168,21,160,100,201,21,94,245,181,15,183,131,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
