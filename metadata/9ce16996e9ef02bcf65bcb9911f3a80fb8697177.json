Johnny Cash was at the height of his popularity when he recorded this song live at San Quentin State Prison in California. The concert was recorded for broadcast by Granada Television on February 24, 1969 and for the Johnny Cash At San Quentin album. The song became Cash's biggest hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, spending three weeks at #2 in 1969; it also topped the country music and adult contemporary charts that same year.\n\nThe song tells the preposterous, yet moving, tale of a young man's quest for revenge on an absent father, whose only contribution to his entire life was naming him Sue, commonly a feminine name, which regularly resulted in the young man suffering from ridicule and bullying. Because of the bullying, Sue grows up tough and smartens up very quickly, though he must move to other towns constantly because of the shame his name gives him. Angered by this he swears he shall find and murder his father for giving him the accursed name.\n\nSue would later find his father and confront him, resulting in a vicious brawl. After the two have beaten each other almost senseless, Sue's father admits that the name was given to him as an act of love: because he knew he would not be there for his son, Sue's father gave him that name to make sure that he grew up strong. Learning this, Sue forgives his father and they have an emotional reconciliation.\n\nWith his lesson learned, Sue closes the song with an announcement: &quot;And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him . . . Bill or George, any damn thing but Sue! I still hate that name!&quot;\n\nThe song has an unusual A-A-C B-B-C rhyme scheme, broken only to mark the dramatic midpoint and comic ending, and is full of vivid images such as &quot;he kicked like a mule and bit like a crocodile&quot;. The song is mostly recitation rather than conventional singing.\n\nYears later Silverstein wrote a follow-up named &quot;The Father of a Boy Named Sue&quot; in which he tells the old man's point of view of the story.\n\nWith the 1960s public decorum being more conservative, the term &quot;son-of-a-bitch&quot; in the line &quot;I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue!&quot; was censored in the radio version, and the final line was edited to take out the &quot;damn&quot;. Both the edited and unedited versions are available on various CDs.\n\nAt San Quentin is a recording of a live concert given by Johnny Cash to the inmates of San Quentin State Prison. As well as being released on record the concert was filmed by Granada Television.\n\nOn the original LP release, the song order was changed and several songs were cut, probably for space reasons. Despite the title of the version released on CD in 2000 (&quot;At San Quentin (The Complete 1969 Concert)&quot;), the CD does not contain the entire concert uncut, but does feature additional tracks and running order that parallels the actual setlist. Performed but not included were the songs &quot;Jackson&quot; and &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot; which are included in the video release of the show.\n\nIn 2006, Legacy Recordings released another deluxe version titled At San Quentin - Legacy Edition. The three-disc version included two CDs containing 31 selections, 13 of them previously unissued, plus a DVD of the original documentary. There are also interviews, some searingly candid, with the prisoners and guards who were present when the Johnny Cash Show packed the prison.\n\nThe album was nominated for a number of Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and won Best Male Country Vocal Performance for &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ce16996e9ef02bcf65bcb9911f3a80fb8697177","amp;dn":"Johnny+Cash+-+A+Boy+Named+Sue+%28Beat+Club%29+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ce16996e9ef02bcf65bcb9911f3a80fb8697177","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,225,105,150,233,239,2,188,246,91,203,153,17,243,168,15,184,105,113,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
