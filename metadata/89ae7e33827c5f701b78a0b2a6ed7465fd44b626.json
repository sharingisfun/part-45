Johnson) that this set really explodes. Garrett's passion inspires\nWatts during their midsong duet and adds a great deal of energy during the three\nsongs on which he appears, completely stealing the show. Watts takes a surprise\nvocal on &quot;Like the Rose&quot; and plays with intensity throughout the performance,\nbut it is Kenny Garrett who makes the music something special; it is a pity that\nhe is not on the first two numbers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89ae7e33827c5f701b78a0b2a6ed7465fd44b626","amp;dn":"Jeff+%5C%22Tain%5C%22+Watts+-+Detained+At+The+Blue+Note+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89ae7e33827c5f701b78a0b2a6ed7465fd44b626","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,174,126,51,130,124,95,112,27,120,160,178,166,237,116,101,253,68,182,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
