The volumes highlight major events and important military, political, and cultural players, offering fresh perspectives on all of America's conflicts. Bringing these wars together in one source allows readers to see how media affected the conflicts individually, but also understand how the use of the various forms of media (print, radio, television, film, and electronic) have developed and changed over the years.\n\n\n\nHardcover: 860 pages\nPublisher: ABC-CLIO (December 20, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1598842277\nISBN-13: 978-1598842272","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9b001086c11f51e50a7ad150a34f98011a6f277","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Media%2C+Propaganda+in+Wartime+America+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9b001086c11f51e50a7ad150a34f98011a6f277","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,176,1,8,108,17,245,30,80,167,173,21,10,52,249,128,17,166,242,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
