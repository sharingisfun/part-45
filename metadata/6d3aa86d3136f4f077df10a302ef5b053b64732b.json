Only after she tells reporters that a stranger appeared in an airplane alongside hers and hypnotized her into landing, and after he meets his own guiding stranger does he solve the bigger mystery: how each of us creates, step by step, what seems to be the solid world around us. The best mysteries are the ones whose answers lie in front of us, in plain sight. The best solutions are those moments when all of a sudden we realize what we've known all along.\n\n-----------------\n\ncreated by Yasser Adnan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d3aa86d3136f4f077df10a302ef5b053b64732b","amp;dn":"Hypnotizing+Maria+-+by+Richard+Bach+-+Yasser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d3aa86d3136f4f077df10a302ef5b053b64732b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,58,168,109,49,54,244,240,119,223,16,163,2,239,91,5,59,100,115,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
