Physical locales of Akihabara like the Radio Kaikan building can be spotted in the game.[8] According to Chiyomaru Shikura, who headed the planning of Steins;Gate, Akihabara was chosen because it is an easy place for acquiring hardware parts which makes it the ideal place for people interested in inventing and tinkering with things.\n\n\nInfo:\nAudio: Eng/Jap\nSubs: Eng\nEps: 13 - 25\nQuality: Medium/High\nFormat: .mkv\nSize/ep: 80MB +/-\nEncoder: Frozen_Solid [F-D]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c984c27c404af867fdfe45bbf3c0e632e27b580","amp;dn":"%5BF-D%5DSteins%3BGate+Part+2+%5B480P%5D%5BDual-Audio%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c984c27c404af867fdfe45bbf3c0e632e27b580","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,152,76,39,196,4,175,134,127,223,228,91,191,60,14,99,46,39,181,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
