Story is about the mad musician who haunts the opera house and kills off all those who are in his protegeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way towards becoming the headliner.\n\nTuneful operatic numbers and the splendor of the scenic settings in these sequences, combined with excellent group and solo vocalists, count heavily. Nelson Eddy, Susanna Foster and Jane Farrar (niece of operatic star Geraldine Farrar) score individually in singing roles and provide marquee dressing. Third act from [Friedrich von Flotow's opera] Martha and two original opera sketches based on themes from Chopin and Tchaikovsky have been skillfully interwoven.\n\nOutstanding performance is turned in by Claude Rains as the musician who, from a fixation seeking to establish the heroine as a leading opera star, grows into a homicidal maniac. \n\nUniversal lavished money on the opulent sets and Technicolour, the art design and cinematography winning Oscars.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.22gb\nDuration.... 01:32:38\nCodec.......
