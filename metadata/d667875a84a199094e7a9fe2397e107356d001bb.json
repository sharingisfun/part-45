She died unfortunately young of aids.\n\nBorn in Yemen, she developed an affinity for Arabic music with\na Jewish flavour of kinship.\n\n\nThe song Galbi on this CD was by the way on the top of some radio\ncharts in local New York along the way as it has appeal for many from\nmidseatern cultural backgrounds broadly speaking.\n\nIn 1987 &quot;Galbi&quot; was remixed, then in The Netherlands by the Dutch DJ\nPeter Vriends and re-issued as a 12&quot; single on the minor label Street Heat\nwith the subtitle The Dutch Remix, also including the 1984 Israeli Played\nOut remix.\n\nThe latest official remix of &quot;Galbi&quot; was included on the 2008 album Forever\nOfra Haza - Her Greatest Songs Remixed, then remixed and re-produced by German production team Ferris Bueller and Kai Panschow, issued on the Edel Records\nlabel.\n\nThe sounds on this CD are uniquely Eastern broadly speaking (especially\nthe pronounced use of the tambla/tabla) which is also popular in Indian\nand Pakistan music too.\n\nAs such it is a bit hard on the palette for Europeans to enjoy, as\nsuch it is here for those who are of Mideastern descent or cultural affnity\nor curiosity. I hope you find it an interesting CD to listen to once\nall the way through in any event. I can handle it just fine myself\nonce in a while - over the years.\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmusicfromrizzo ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d667875a84a199094e7a9fe2397e107356d001bb","amp;dn":"Ofra+Haza+%28Israel%29+Yemenite+songs+CD+192k+%28musicfromrizzo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d667875a84a199094e7a9fe2397e107356d001bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,103,135,90,132,161,153,9,78,122,159,226,57,126,16,115,86,208,1,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
