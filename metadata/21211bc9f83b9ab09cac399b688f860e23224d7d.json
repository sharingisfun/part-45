But how do you know when something is trivial or really serious? Here at last is a book that can help you decide if and when you should consult a doctor. In this invaluable family health guide, popular doctor Hilary Jones, with the help of charts and illustrations, enables you to diagnose your symptoms and gives practical advice on the sorts of treatment you may need to seek.\n\nHe answers questions such as:\n* How long should a headache last before it becomes abnormal?\n* What is the difference between a twinge of chest pain and a heart attack?\n* How can you tell if a child's rash indicates measles?\n\nIf you have ever worried about your own or you family's health, this comprehensive and reassuring book, with its clear and commonsense approach, will make you feel a great deal better.\n\nCONTENTS\nINTRODUCTION 1\n1 - GENERAL SYMPTOMS 3\n2 - THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 23\n3 - RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS 42\n4 - ABNORMAL PULSE RATES AND PALPITATIONS 52\n5 - PAIN 61\n6 - ABNORMAL BLEEDING Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ 141\n7 - LUMPS AND SWELLINGS 170\n8 - PERSONAL SYMPTOMS 204\n9 - THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 231\n10 - SEXUAL PROBLEMS 279\n11 - THE SKIN 295\n12 - CHILDREN'S SYMPTOMS 315\nINDEX 339\n\nI came across this book last month &amp; as I read through it, I realised that this is one book that deserves to be shared with as many people as possible.
