Unlike most hermeneutical works, this book empowers the student by presenting the Bible's own internal method of self-interpretation.\n\nThe teaching of right division is not a new concept designed by the author, but rather the scriptural mandate of God.\n\nStudy to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. (II Timothy 2:15)\n\nBy allowing the Bible to interpret itself, alleged contradictions and cultic heresies lose their power to confuse. Likewise, difficult passages (the one evaded in the commentaries) are suddenly reconcilable by rightly dividing the word of truth.\n\nUnique in its versatility, One Book Rightly Divided serves as a Christian's study guide, a Bible college textbook, or a pastor's homiletical aid. The reader will be helped by the many illuminating charts and the absence of technical language.\n\nThis volume will enhance the Christian's personal walk with God by providing him with the biblical key to Bible study.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Douglas D. Stauffer is an internationally recognized authority in the field of Bible history and defense. He holds three Bible degrees including a PhD in Religion. Because of his biblical expertise, Oxford University Press commissioned Dr. Stauffer to work as a consulting editor. Along with being a frequent guest speaker on radio and television, he has served for ten years in pastoral ministries and logged thousands of hours teaching through the church and at the college level. He is a prolific author, having written nine books along with many writings published in Christian periodicals.\n\nWhile attending Bible college, Dr. Stauffer passed the CPA exam and went on to enjoy a successful career in the management of several companies. In 1995, he left his position as CFO of a multi-million-dollar corporation in order to dedicate himself more fully to the ministry. Since that time, he has earned a Th.M. in Theology and a PhD in Religion from International Baptist Seminary. Each of his books has been produced into video segments for cable television","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c273ec89452367e083de14297c5df675943a2e68","amp;dn":"One+Book+Rightly+Divided+-+Dr.+Douglas+Stauffer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c273ec89452367e083de14297c5df675943a2e68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,115,236,137,69,35,103,224,131,222,20,41,124,93,246,117,148,58,46,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
