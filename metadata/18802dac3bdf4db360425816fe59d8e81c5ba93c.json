In the face of the outlandish American tax burden, talk-radio firebrand Neal Boortz and Congressman John Linder are leading the charge to phase out our current, unfair system and enact the FairTax Plan, replacing the federal income tax and withholding system with a simple 23 percent retail sales tax on new goods and services. This dramatic revision of the current system, which would eliminate the reviled IRS, has already caught fire in the American heartland, with more than six hundred thousand taxpayers signing on in support of the plan.\n\nAs Boortz and Linder reveal in this first book on the FairTax, this radical but eminently sensible plan would end the annual national nightmare of filing income tax returns, while at the same time enlarging the federal tax base by collecting sales tax from every retail consumer in the country. The FairTax, they argue, would transform the fearsome bureaucracy of the IRS into a more transparent, accountable, and equitable tax collection system. Among other benefits, it will:\n\nMake Americas tax code truly voluntary, without reducing revenue\nReplace todays indecipherable tax code with one simple sales tax\nProtect lower-income Americans by covering the tax on basic necessities\nEliminate billions of dollars in embedded taxes we dont even know were paying\nBring offshore corporate dollars back into the U.S. economy\nEndorsed by scores of leading economists and supported by a huge and growing grassroots movement, the FairTax Plan could revolutionize the way America pays for itself. In this straight-talking book, Neal Boortz and John Linder show you how it would workÃ¢â‚¬â€and how you can help make it happen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18802dac3bdf4db360425816fe59d8e81c5ba93c","amp;dn":"Neal+Boortz+-+2006+-+The+FairTax+Book+-+56kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18802dac3bdf4db360425816fe59d8e81c5ba93c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,128,45,172,59,223,77,179,96,66,88,22,254,89,216,232,28,91,169,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
