Hornung and Johnson, deliberately by-passing the arts of painting and prints, have succeeded admirably in their limited aim. They trace in concise, well-balanced and accurate terms the development of American graphics through the earliest Colonial newspapers, almanacs, Franklin's contributions, William Caslon's types (used in the first printing of the Declaration), the &quot;Gothic revival&quot; and every technical innovation up to contemporary printing and its flourishing diversity as shown in advertising, photo reproduction, book design, poster art and much else.\nSome three hundred illustrations help make this one of the finest single volumes available on the subject, and a good Bicentennial item.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0742bd38dba9e019b6c2894783c87ec668c417a","amp;dn":"200+Years+of+American+graphic+art+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0742bd38dba9e019b6c2894783c87ec668c417a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,116,43,211,141,186,158,1,155,108,40,148,120,60,135,236,102,140,65,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
