Now, 6 years later, the band make a triumphant return to the Australian music scene with their first album in 10 years, Songs Of The Third and Fifth. Recorded in Adelaide and mixed by John Scott, long time manager Tim Pittman (Feel Presents) and engineer Forrester Savell (Karnivool, Cog, Birds Of Tokyo), the album is a stunning come back. Two digital-only singles, 'Barkhammer' and 'Heart of Stone', have already been released to whet the appetite of fans, whilst longtime friend and producer of the band, Henry Rollins, wrote and laid down a spoken word vocal part to the track 'Grey 11'. \nTrack Listing\n\n1.\tBarkhammer\n2.\tAvenger\n3.\tSeparatist\n4.\tMilosovic\n5.\tEastern Decline\n6.\tGrey 11\n7.\t1000 Yards\n8.\tThe Argument\n9.\tHeart of Stone\n\nIf you like it buy it!  \n\nEnjoy &amp; Seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5a747faa4295d0cfeb2285b719cf6264902dce1","amp;dn":"The+Mark+of+Cain+-+Songs+Of+The+Third+And+Fifth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5a747faa4295d0cfeb2285b719cf6264902dce1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,167,71,250,164,41,93,12,254,178,40,91,113,156,246,38,73,2,220,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
