In October 2012, Alestorm toured North America with Epica, Insomnium, System Divide, and Destiny Potato. Alestorm dressed as characters from Batman in honor of their Halloween performance in Toronto and introduced themselves as Christian Balestorm.[citation needed]\n\nStarting from late September, Alestorm toured as the main support band for DragonForce. They appeared third at all shows after Cavorts and The Defiled.[21]\n\nIn January 2013 Alestorm returned to Australia and New Zealand filming their first live DVD.[22][23]&quot;Live at The End of The World&quot; was released worldwide later that year.[24] This DVD release followed their cover of the Village People track &quot;In The Navy&quot;[24]\n\nIn July 2013, Alestorm played at Metalcamp and at Wacken Open Air in Germany in August.\n\nIn November and December 2013, Alestorm headlined a tour in North America supported by Trollfest and Gypsyhawk.\n\nThe band released their fourth record entitled &quot;Sunset on the Golden Age&quot; on August 1, 2014, a week before its appearance at the 2014 edition of Heavy MONTREAL.\nBand members1.Walk the Plank\n2.Drink\n3.Magnetic North\n4.1741 (The Battle of Cartagena)\n5.Mead from Hell\n6.Surf Squid Warfare\n7.Quest for Ships\n8.Wooden Leg!\n9.Hangover (Taio Cruz Cover)\n10.Sunset on the Golden Age \n1.Over the Seas (Acoustic Version)\n2.Nancy the Tavern Witch (Acoustic Version)\n3.Keelhauled (Acoustic Version)\n4.The Sunk'n Norwegian (Acoustic Version)\n5.Shipwrecked (Acoustic Version)\n6.Questing upon the Poop Deck (Bonus Track) \nCurrent members\n\n    Christopher Bowes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals, keyboards, keytar (2004Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Dani Evans Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar (2008Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent), bass guitar (2006Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2008), backing vocals (2006Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Gareth Murdock Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar, backing vocals (2008Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Elliot Vernon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards, backing vocals (2011Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Peter Alcorn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (2010Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nSession members\n\n    Alex Tabisz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (2008)\n\nFormer members\n\n    Gavin Harper Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, backing vocals (2004Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2008)\n    Doug Swierczek Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (2006Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2007)\n    Robin Hellier Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals (2006)\n    Ian Wilson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion (2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2008, 2008Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2010)\nMetal from a Metal/HardRock/Classic Uploader.
