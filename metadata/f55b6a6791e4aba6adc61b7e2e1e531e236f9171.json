The first edition, by George H. Chase, appeared in 1950. This edition was revised and amended in 1963 by eminent Classical scholar Cornelius C. Vermeule III and again in 1972 by Dr. Vermeule and Mary B. Comstock. The authors lay the foundation for the work by describing the museum's holdings representing the prehistoric civilizations of Greece and Crete, the early Iron Age, and the period of Oriental influence that preceded the historic Greek Archaic Period. The Greek art is further divided into chapters describing the first and second halves of the fifth century B.C. (the former represented by red-figure vases and the latter by classical sculpture and coins), the fourth century B.C., and the Hellenistic and Graeco-Roman periods. The art of the Etruscans is represented by sculpture and wall painting in addition to the famous bronzes. Roman art is covered in the rest of the book, but in less detail than the Greek, though nearly all forms are represented, including statuary, pottery, coinage, and textile. In all, some 286 pieces are covered and illustrated with crisp black-and-white photographs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f55b6a6791e4aba6adc61b7e2e1e531e236f9171","amp;dn":"Greek%2C+Etruscan+and+Roman+Art+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f55b6a6791e4aba6adc61b7e2e1e531e236f9171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,91,106,103,145,228,171,166,173,198,27,126,46,30,83,30,35,111,145,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
