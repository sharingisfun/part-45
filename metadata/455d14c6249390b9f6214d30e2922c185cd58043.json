The line-up included Sal Polichetti (bass, vocals); his then wife Patricia Costagliola (keyboards, vocals); Frank Franco (guitar, vocals); Kevin McGillen (backup vocals); and Nicky Sciarra (drums). Their sole album, First Fruit, was released in 1981. A proposed follow-up, Just Can't Get Enough (Of Jesus!!!), with more new wave and New Romantic elements, never saw official release, but some bootleg tracks have surfaced. Nicky Sciarra became district manager of Community Board 7 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. He died in 1993 after apparently choking on a sandwich.\n\nThe band came back into the spotlight in 2008 when a recording of them performing their song 'Jesus Is A Friend Of Mine', from a religious TV show, appeared on the Dougsploitation blog, and subsequently became ahit, where it spawned several parodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------\nCopy.
