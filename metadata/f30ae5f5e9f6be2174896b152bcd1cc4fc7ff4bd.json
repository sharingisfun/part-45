This is the traditional behavior you expected from VideoReDo in the past.\n\nOutput Profiles:\nThe output format is determined by a list of file types, called profiles, in the file save box. The product comes with quite a few profiles which can serve as a starting point. You can create your own profiles, exchange profiles with other users using the import and export mechanism. There will be more on profiles in a separate post.
