It was written by noted horror author Joe R. Lansdale and originally aired on October 19, 1992. In this episode, Bruce Wayne awakes in a seemingly idyllic dream world in which his parents are still alive and he never became Batman. The title is taken from the famous soliloquy from Shakespeare's Hamlet.\n\nFor more info go to &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perchance_to_Dream_%28Batman:_The_Animated_Series%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perchance_to_Dream_%28Batman:_The_Animated_Series%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt's one of my favorite episodes.\n\nIt's a DVDrip in mkv format.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e99c9926eb5b5da022ca876636c578bbda4c927","amp;dn":"Batman+Animated+-+Perchance+To+Dream","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e99c9926eb5b5da022ca876636c578bbda4c927","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,153,201,146,110,181,181,218,2,44,168,118,99,108,87,139,189,164,201,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
