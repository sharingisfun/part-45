Works \nperfectly with the Skullptura Rip(Left.4.Dead.Full-Rip.Skullptura).  \n\nPlease follow the Readme before doing anything.\n\nAnswers to Common Questions:\n\nWhere is my Left 4 Dead Directory?\n-Its the folder that says Left 4 Dead which has all your Left 4 Dead Files.  For example, for me, its in \nC:Program Files (x86)Left.4.Dead.Full-Rip.SkullpturaLeft 4 Dead\n\nWhy do i need Visual C++ 2008 and Microsft .Net Framework 3.5?\n-Because the Standalone Package won't work without it.\n\nWhy do i need two files for patching?\n-The 1.0.0.9 file is the actual patching of your game.  The standalone is for bypassing steam so steam doesnt annoy the crap out of you.  If you don't install the standalone, steam will prevent you from playing the game and have you make a steam account.  In a worse case scenario, you probably can't play at all without the Standalone.  Also, this Standalone package prepares the game for online play using Garena, Himachi, etc.  To find out how, do some research.\n\n\nYes i know that your L4D rip can already play without Standalone but once you patch the game, it may restore Steam files which will prevent you from playing which is why you need the standalone.  \n\nWorks for all Left 4 Dead Rips, Cracks, Hacks, Bootlegs, watever you wanna call them.  This patch is not only for Skullptura.\n\nComments and Questions\n\nUPDATE: GARENA IS NOW BACK ONLINE!!!\nPlease use this to play L4D on Garena &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.garena.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=455930&amp;extra=page%3D1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.garena.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=455930&amp;extra=page%3D1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIn the guide that will be shown in the above link,please skip to step 4 in order to avoid repeating steps...  The steps 1-4 will be covered in this patch.  When u are done patching the game, continue from step 4 in the link.\n-------------------------\nFOR THOSE WHO ARE TECHNOLOGICALLY INADEQUATE, PLEASE GO TO &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4747402&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4747402&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTHIS IS MY ALTERNATE PATCH WITH THE SAME PATCHING FILES BUT WITH A COMPREHENSIVE STEP BY STEP README GUIDE THAT WILL HELP EVEN THE MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY INADEQUATE OF PEOPLE!!!
