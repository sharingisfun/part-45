He's equally passionate with trippy riddles (has anybody figured out what &quot;We've got mother nature on the run&quot; means in the title track?) and pointed protest (after 30 years of rock-radio overplay, &quot;Southern Man&quot; still rings with truth about redneck racism). His creaky ensemble, including pianist Jack Nitzsche and rotating members of Crazy Horse, transforms ramshackle\ncountry and folk songs into soulful hippie hymns. --Steve Knopper\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Tell me why                                          [02:58]\n02.After the gold rush                                  [03:46]\n03.Only love can break your heart                       [03:08]\n04.Southern man                                         [05:32]\n05.Till the morning comes                               [01:21]\n06.Oh, lonesome me                                      [03:50]\n07.Don't let it bring you down                          [02:58]\n08.Birds                                                [02:33]\n09.When you dance you can really love                   [04:05]\n10.I believe in you                                     [03:28]\n11.Cripple creek ferry                                  [01:34]\n____\n\n35:13 min\n 49,4 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
