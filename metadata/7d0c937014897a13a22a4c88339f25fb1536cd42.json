It includes bin/cue CD image files of the original installation CD.\n\nThis release includes LaunchBox (and DOSBox) which will allow you to easily play\nthe game on modern Windows PCs. No configuration or installation is necessary.\nSimply run LaunchBox.exe and then double-click on the game to play.\n\nAll the circuits and drivers of the 1994 Formula 1 World Championship is\nrecreated in Geoff Crammond's second racing simulation. The game is viewed from\nwithin the cockpit - external views are provided primarily for use in replays or\ndemonstrations. Texture mapping and full detail in the rear view mirrors are\navailable for almost every visible feature.\n\nThe game has 5 skill levels, 7 driving aids such as automatic brakes and a\ndotted 'ideal racing line' to follow available on lower skill levels, and\nvariable race and practice session lengths. You will have to alter the car's\nsetup to get the best possible car performance - this ranges from standard\nfeatures such as brake balance and gear ratios onto more technical ones such as\nspring settings and the ride height. Multiplayer games involve either taking it\nin turns on a single computer, or on a linkup.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d0c937014897a13a22a4c88339f25fb1536cd42","amp;dn":"Grand+Prix+II+%281995%29+%28PC+Game%29+%28HereticXS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d0c937014897a13a22a4c88339f25fb1536cd42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,12,147,112,20,137,122,19,162,42,76,136,51,159,37,251,21,54,205,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
