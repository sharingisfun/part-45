The songs marked * are from the Rotterdam show, \r\nand for the first time is PANIC IN DETROIT from that show available on disc. \r\nThe Rotterdam songs are sound-board recordings just like the previously available songs from the same concert. \r\nThe only unreleased song from that show now is QUEEN BITCH. Very nice &quot;filler bits&quot;! \r\nThe CD is said to be Japanese, but it is Italian. Anyway, a disc I warmly recommend! -BASSMAN[/quote]\r\n\r\n1. Panic In Detroit\r\n2. Fame\r\n3. Changes\r\n4.
