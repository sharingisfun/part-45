Could this be the secret of youth we have all been searching for?\n\nNOTES: So, for some reason this aired exclusively on Discovery Channel Asia Pacific, so tracking down a copy of source video that WASN'T from youtube was a pain.\nI don't speak Chinese, but had to look for the source in Chinese. LOL Anyway, after some searching, I was able to track down a decent copy, which I re-cropped to a 16/9, which cut MOST of the Chinese subtitles that were Hard-coded into the original video. I, also, ran it through some filters in Vegas and the result is pretty decent considering the source video I had to work with. Personally, I wouldn't give this video any higher than a 7/10 for Video and 9/10 for Audio (which was actually nice.)\n\nStill, for those interested, I wanted to share my work.\n\nTech details: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7c4448440448444c3c4e4552454b1a0c0f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;@2700Kbps with 2 Ch stereo aac@192Kbps\n\nAs always, enjoy and if you download then PLEASE seed;) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0227bdd622b050ebada63642132c0390cb6d46a","amp;dn":"Discovery.Channel.Revealed.DNA.The.Next.Wave.2012.480p.HDTV.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0227bdd622b050ebada63642132c0390cb6d46a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,34,123,221,98,43,5,14,186,218,99,100,33,50,192,57,12,182,212,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
