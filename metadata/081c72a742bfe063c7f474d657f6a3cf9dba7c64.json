It stars\nDaniel Craig, Nicole Kidman, Eva Green and Dakota Blue Richards. The project\nwas announced in February 2002, following the success of recent adaptations of\nother fantasy epics, but troubles over the script and the selection of a director\ncaused significant delays. At US$180 million, it was one of New Line's most\nexpensive projects ever, and its middling success in the US contributed to New\nLine's February 2008 restructuring.\n\nThe story concerns Lyra, an orphan living in a fantastical parallel universe in which\na dogmatic theocracy called the Magisterium threatens to dominate the world.\nWhen Lyra's friend is kidnapped, she travels to the far North in an attempt to\nrescue him and rejoin her uncle.\n\nBefore its release, the film received criticism from secular organizations and fans of\nHis Dark Materials for the dilution of the religious elements from the novels, as well\nas from some religious organizations for the source material's anti-Christian and\natheistic themes. The film met with mixed reviews, however it did gain both an\nAcademy Award and a BAFTA for visual effects; and, despite not meeting\nexpectations at the U.S. box office, was commercially successful taking in over\n$372 million worldwide to date.\n\n\nIn a parallel universe (a person's soul resides outside the body in an animal-like\nform called a &quot;daemon&quot;, Europe is controlled by an authoritarian organization\ncalled the Magisterium. In Oxford, orphaned Lyra Belacqua, a ward of Jordan\nCollege, tells tales of the &quot;Gobblers&quot;, whom she and her friends believe are\nresponsible for several local children's disappearance. Visiting the college is Lyra's\nuncle, Lord Asriel, who, against official Magisterium doctrine, is presenting\nevidence that particles called &quot;Dust&quot; exist. After Lyra saves Asriel from an\nassassination attempt by a Magisterial representative, the college funds his\nexpedition to the far north to investigate the Dust substance. He believes it\noriginates in a parallel universe and enters a person's body via their dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦mon.\nFearing the effects of Dust, the Magisterium has been experimenting on children to\ndiscover a way to inoculate others against it.\n\n\nFormat : MPEG-4\nCodec ID : mp42\nFile size : 4.34 GiB\nDuration : 1h 53mn\nOverall bit rate : 5479 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;eaa2838d82aaa6dec4db&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nCodec ID : avc1\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration : 1h 53mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 5091 Kbps\nWidth : 1920 pixels\nHeight : 1080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16/9 ~ 2.35 : 1\nFrame rate mode : Variable\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nResolution : 24 bits\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.102\n\nAudio\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version : Version 4\nFormat profile : LC\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 384 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate : 628 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Rear: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\nJacket &amp; DVD @ 600dpi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:081c72a742bfe063c7f474d657f6a3cf9dba7c64","amp;dn":"The+Golden+Compass+1080p+BDRip+%5BH.264-MP4%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"081c72a742bfe063c7f474d657f6a3cf9dba7c64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,28,114,167,66,191,224,99,199,244,116,214,87,246,163,207,157,186,124,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
