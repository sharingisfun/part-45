This one is about medical missionaries in an unnamed African country. Our missionary heroes (played very badly by Jack and Barbara Buttram) are loved by the local people but not by the evil muslim authorities who don't like that they're preaching Christianity. The film expects us to sympathise with a protagonist who is a doctor but by his own admission is more concerned with converting his patients to Christianity than treating their illnesses.\n\n\nLike all the films from this school it's very ambitious. They composed and recorded the soundtrack, built miniature sets (see extras), etc. For a film made in South Carolina they created a pretty convincing Africa. Unfortunately the script is awful and the acting ranges from wooden to laugable. And considering the portrayals of Africans, it's interesting to know that Bob Jones Univeristy didn't allow black students until the 1970s and forbid interracial among their students until 2000. (for more on that, check Wikipedia). Anyway, they found lots of black actors and extras for this film, but I can swear at least one of the Africans is a white guy in blackface.\n\n\nExtras: Two behind the scenes features, one about the soundtrack and one about the miniature sets.\n\n----------------\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nFile Name .......................................: Beyond the Night 1983 CG.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 734,150,656 bytes\nRuntime .........................................: 1:02:37\n\nVideo Info\nVideo Codec .....................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 624x464 (AR: 1.345)\nFPS .............................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1441 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ..................................: 0.208 bpp\nCompatibillity...................................: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Info\nAudio Codec .....................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate .....................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 109 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams ............................: 1 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d18514ce38bdbd90c517601edf64d58888dd1838","amp;dn":"Beyond+the+Night+%28rare+Christian+movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d18514ce38bdbd90c517601edf64d58888dd1838","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,133,20,206,56,189,189,144,197,23,96,30,223,100,213,136,136,221,24,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
