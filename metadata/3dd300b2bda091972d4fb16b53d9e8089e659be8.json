The books and monographs are equally suitable for learning and reference, and relevant topics are experimental techniques whose mastery requires a knowledge that can conveniently be contained in a book, as well as topics in fluid dynamics where understanding is based largely, though not necessarily exclusively, upon experiments. Thus, the books may contain up to one-third theory, and each one is a complete, integrated discourse, as opposed to a group of essays on selected sub-topics, with an editor or principal author responsible for unifying the conceptual content","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dd300b2bda091972d4fb16b53d9e8089e659be8","amp;dn":"Experimental+Fluid+Mechanics+%5BUpdated+at+2016.03.18%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dd300b2bda091972d4fb16b53d9e8089e659be8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,211,0,178,189,160,145,151,45,79,177,107,83,217,232,8,158,101,155,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
