Containing 500 contemporary images by leading photographers, this indispensable manual explains posing fundamentals as well as how to create a flattering, feature-specific photograph-one that focuses on the head, shoulders, arms, torso, or feet-in different levels of close-ups, from head-shots to full-lengths.\n\n\nBy Michelle Perkins\nPublished by Amherst Media Inc. in 2009\nEPUB, Retail, 128 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e024256b94f75ae92993bdde27db7b0756a4b2bb","amp;dn":"500+Poses+for+Photographing+Women%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e024256b94f75ae92993bdde27db7b0756a4b2bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,36,37,107,148,247,90,233,41,147,189,222,39,219,123,7,86,164,178,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
