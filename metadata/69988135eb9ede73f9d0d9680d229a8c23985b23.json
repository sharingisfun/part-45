The group was part of the English New Wave movement that included bands like Duran Duran and had a string of early hit singles. \n\nThis Greatest Hits collection includes a couple of fan favourites. The non album single Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Foolish FriendÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Happiness is EasyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ off the Colour of Spring album and when selecting the tracks they opted for the album versions as opposed to the 7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ single versions.\n\nMark Hollis and his bandmates are seen as some of the more interesting acts to come out of the synthpop movement of the 1980s. Still one of my favourite bands of the 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69988135eb9ede73f9d0d9680d229a8c23985b23","amp;dn":"Talk+Talk+-+Essential+%282011%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69988135eb9ede73f9d0d9680d229a8c23985b23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,152,129,53,235,158,222,115,249,208,217,104,13,34,154,140,35,152,91,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
