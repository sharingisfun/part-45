Detective Lieutenant Kari TakamÃƒÂ¤kis homicide team gets a case that looks like a professional hit but they are perplexed by the crime scene.\n\nTakamÃƒÂ¤kis trusted man Suhonen goes undercover as Suikkanen, a gangster full of action. In pursuit of the murderer, he must operate within the grey area of the law. But, will the end justify the means?\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of popular Scandinavian writers, Jarkko Sipila is introducing his critically acclaimed TakamÃƒÂ¤ki series in the United States.\n\nJarkko Sipila, 45, is a Finnish author and journalist.

Through realistic characters and complex plots, the author discusses current topics surrounding Finnish society and unveils glimpses into his homeland.\n\nReview by Ulla Suokko for New World Finn: ...this book is skillfully composed and intelligently written in its slow-moving tough-guy tenor. True to his genre, Mr. Sipila hooks the reader by zooming through the windows of a tight timeline and feeding the pieces of the murder puzzle bit by bit through the eyes and minds of his characters...\n\nPeter Ohlsson - Scandinavianbooks dot com: ....Against the Wall is very well plotted. It is written is a slow-moving and direct style. Pieces of the puzzle and the larger plot become visible gradually, and this serves to build the excitement towards a plausible and interesting ending. As well, the characters, while not being fully drawn, are realistic and very interesting. I enjoyed reading it, and strongly recommend it.\n\nNothing But The Truth is the third book translated into English in the prize-winning crime fiction series Helsinki Homicide by Finnish writer Jarkko Sipila. Like the two previous books in the series, it focuses on the Violent Crimes Unit in the Helsinki Police. The key characters are Detective Lieutenant Kari TakamÃƒÂ¤ki and the undercover detective Suhonen. Like the previous books, Nothing But The Truth too is a noir crime fiction novel, written in a relatively stark and direct style.\n\nOutside an apartment building in Helsinki, a young cocaine dealer is gunned down. Detective Lieutenant Kari TakamÃƒÂ¤ki and his homicide team move quickly and succeed in finding and arresting the shooter, a well known criminal named Esa Nyberg. So far so good. But Nyberg doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t talk Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all he says is Ã¢â‚¬Å“No commentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Even though they have the killer, TakamÃƒÂ¤ki and his team want more: They want to know why the dealer was shot. And Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in particular Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they want to know who ordered the killing.\n\nThe Violent Crimes unit knows most of what there is to know about the criminal underworld in Helsinki. And they know Nyberg works with a very ruthless psychopath and crime boss named Risto Korpi. They suspect he is the man behind the execution. But pinning the crime on him will be difficult unless someone talks. But, as TakamÃƒÂ¤ki know too well Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Korpi and his men will not talk.\n\nThen, after the police have issued a statement to the media and asked witnesses to the crime to step forward, a woman from a neighboring building Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a lady with photographic memory - comes forward with an image of the getaway driver's face and the registration number of the car. All the pieces fall into place, and Korpi is arrested and brought to trial.\n\nAmidst freezing rain, Timo Repo escapes from his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funeral. Detective Lieutenant Kari TakamÃƒÂ¤ki and his homicide team must return the convicted wife-murderer back to prison. But as the manhunt begins, TakamÃƒÂ¤ki's team starts digging into old evidence. Why would Repo flee now, with over half his sentence completed? Was he guilty after all? Or was he an innocent man unjustly sentenced to life in prison -- and to losing his only son? Timo RepoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s escape is no longer a routine case. \n\nHelsinki Homicide: Cold Trail deliberates taking justice into your own hands. While TakamÃƒÂ¤ki ponders whether the legal system always gets it right, Repo battles with his conscience and those who have wronged him.\n\nThe novel is yet another thrilling read from Sipila, full of his trademark rugged realism. The sequel to Nothing but the Truth is the fourth of his novels to be translated into English.
