Beginning with the basic concepts of the physics of strongly correlated electron systems, the structure of transition metal ions, and the behaviours of transition metal ions in crystals, it goes on to cover more advanced topics such as metal-insulator transitions, orbital ordering, and novel phenomena such as multiferroics, systems with oxygen holes, and high-Tc superconductivity. Each chapter concludes with a summary of key facts and concepts, presenting all the most important information in a consistent and concise manner. Set within a modern conceptual framework, and providing a complete treatment of the fundamental factors and mechanisms that determine the properties of transition metal compounds, this is an invaluable resource for graduate students, researchers and industrial practitioners in solid state physics and chemistry, materials science, and inorganic chemistry.\n\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press (23 October 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1107020174\nISBN-13: 978-1107020177","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df3e67e3ebd342dc93912900cd51a4ed350c5917","amp;dn":"%5BDaniel+I.+Khomskii%5DTransition+Metal+Compounds%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df3e67e3ebd342dc93912900cd51a4ed350c5917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,62,103,227,235,211,66,220,147,145,41,0,205,81,164,237,53,12,89,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
