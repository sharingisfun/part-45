(All content from BD discs 1 and 2)\n\nSo, I've decided to scrap the 1080p encodes, and do this in 720p. This lets me use a lower CRF setting (which means higher quality) and not use any degraining at all, and not wind up with crazy high filesizes. And since Mospeada is a 16mm show, there's not much lost at all going from 1080 to 720.\n\nAnyway, as the Mospeada BDs have no grain reduction at all, these encodes are wonderfully grainy. This is grain that makes RX of Encodergasm go &quot;That's a bit much&quot;.\n\nVideo: 10-bit x264, 720p, crf 22\nAudio: AAC 50%\nSubtitles: Retimed ADV, done in yellow.\n\n\n[Bunny Hat]Genesis Climber Mospeada (BD) (720p,10-bit x264,AAC) Episodes 1-13\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71cbd02043f0be7e9322a39567c2062c524b7bbc","amp;dn":"%5BBunny+Hat%5D+Genesis+Climber+Mospeada+%28BD%29+%28720p%2C10-bit+x264%2CAAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71cbd02043f0be7e9322a39567c2062c524b7bbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,203,208,32,67,240,190,126,147,34,163,149,103,194,6,44,82,75,123,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
