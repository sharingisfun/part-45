Formed in 1983, Bon Jovi consists of lead singer and namesake Jon Bon Jovi, guitarist Richie Sambora, keyboardist David Bryan, drummer Tico Torres, former bassist Alec John Such, as well as current bassist Hugh McDonald. The band's line-up has remained mostly static during their 26-year history, the only exception being the departure of Alec John Such in 1994, who was unofficially replaced by Hugh McDonald. The band have become known for writing several rock anthems, and achieved widespread recognition with their third album Slippery When Wet, released in 1986. Bon Jovi are well-known for songs including &quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot;, which has become their signature song, as well as &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot;, &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;, &quot;Bad Medicine&quot;, &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;, &quot;Bed of Roses&quot;, &quot;Always&quot;, &quot;It's My Life&quot; and &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;. Their latest hit single is &quot;We Weren't Born to Follow.&quot;\n\nJennifer Nettles (born September 12, 1974) is an American country music artist. She is known primarily for her role as lead vocalist of the duo Sugarland alongside Kristian Bush. Before Sugarland's inception, she also fronted Atlanta, Georgia-based bands called Soul Miner's Daughter and Jennifer Nettles Band. She also charted as a duet partner on the country version of rock band Bon Jovi's 2006 single &quot;Who Says You Can't Go Home&quot;, a Number One hit on the Billboard charts.\n\nIn 2003, Nettles teamed up with Kristen Hall and Kristian Bush to form Sugarland. Regarding the trio's collaboration, she said:\n\n    &quot;We really wanted to get out of where we had all been as artists and move beyond that to something bigger. Consequently all the songs reflect that; 'Fly Away,' 'Baby Girl,' all of those songs - you speak to the human condition and write what you know in your life.&quot;\n\nSugarland was nominated for a Grammy award in the Best New Artist category in 2006. Although they did not win the award, Nettles and Bush performed for the awards show and Nettles presented both a Lifetime Achievement Award to Merle Haggard and the award for Best Country Group.\n\nA duet performance with rock band Bon Jovi, &quot;Who Says You Can't Go Home&quot;, reached No. 7 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart and No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. The video for the song won a CMT Music Award in 2006 for Collaborative Video Of The Year. In February 2007, Nettles and Bon Jovi won a Grammy for Best Country Vocal Collaboration. In 2006, Kristen Hall left the group and Nettles and Bush continued on as a duo releasing Enjoy the Ride in November 2006. Their third album, titled Love on the Inside, was released on July 22, 2008.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9c16f4d8cf2e06e2de90b2893257d6c849bc303","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+%26+Jennifer+Nettles-Live+2010+Grammy+Awards%28Xvid-2nafish","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9c16f4d8cf2e06e2de90b2893257d6c849bc303","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,193,111,77,140,242,224,110,45,233,11,40,147,37,125,108,132,155,195,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
