Clearly Dean's show\nhad a much larger budget which included better writers.\n\nI only have a couple of episodes, not including the Sonny &amp; Cher episode \nthat I acquired on VHS some 24 years ago. Although the video quality \nis decent, this and the other one (a second generation copy) has Spanish subtitles. The guy who uploaded this to You Tube must have gotten it off \na Spanish TV station..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fab09052c9d5fa9b6c22f6290fc8238416177c3f","amp;dn":"THE+JERRY+LEWIS+SHOW+--+Frank+Gorshin%2C+The+McGuire+Sisters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fab09052c9d5fa9b6c22f6290fc8238416177c3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,176,144,82,201,213,250,155,108,34,246,41,15,200,35,132,22,23,124,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
