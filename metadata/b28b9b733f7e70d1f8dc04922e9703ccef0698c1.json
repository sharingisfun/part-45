And meet Thrasne, a young boatman who trades from town to town, free from the iron control of the towers of the Awakeners, and the priests of the world of the River--free, that is, as long as he never speaks his mind. These two, by design and accident both, are about to discover many truths. And on the Northshore of the River, the truth can kill you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b28b9b733f7e70d1f8dc04922e9703ccef0698c1","amp;dn":"The+Awakeners+-+Northshore+%26amp%3B+Southshore+-+Sheri+S.+Tepper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b28b9b733f7e70d1f8dc04922e9703ccef0698c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,139,155,115,63,126,112,209,248,220,4,146,46,151,3,204,239,6,152,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
