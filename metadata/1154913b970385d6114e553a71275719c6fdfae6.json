For example, the MMR vaccine is \nnot associated with autism or childhood diabetes. The DTaP vaccine is also not associated with diabetes and \nthe influenza vaccine given as a shot does not exacerbate asthma. \n\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1154913b970385d6114e553a71275719c6fdfae6","amp;dn":"Adverse+Effects+of+Vaccines-+Evidence+and+Causality%5BTeam+Nanban%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1154913b970385d6114e553a71275719c6fdfae6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,84,145,59,151,3,133,214,17,78,85,58,113,39,87,25,198,253,250,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
