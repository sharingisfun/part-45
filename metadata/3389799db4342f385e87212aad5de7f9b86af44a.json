In a two-year span, he had eight Top 40 singles, two of which were #1 records and a #1 album. Despite being one of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most-loved artists, there has never been a video document of his career. Until now.\n\nHave You Heard: Jim Croce Live, features the late singer-songwriterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performances on television in the early 1970Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s. Set in an intimate style akin to todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s popular Unplugged series, the DVD includes performances of such classic Croce songs as &quot;You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Mess Around With Jim,&quot; &quot;Operator (ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Not The Way It Feels),&quot; &quot;Bad, Bad LeRoy Brown,&quot; many not seen since they were originally broadcast.\n\nJim CroceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s widow, Ingrid, and their son A.J., provide special narration, filled with intimate anecdotes and stirring memories of their lives. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1002989/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1002989/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEnjoy,\n\nJediMaster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3389799db4342f385e87212aad5de7f9b86af44a","amp;dn":"Jim+Croce+Live+-+Have+You+Heard+%282003%29+480p+JediMaster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3389799db4342f385e87212aad5de7f9b86af44a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,137,121,157,180,52,47,56,94,135,33,42,173,93,231,249,184,106,244,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
