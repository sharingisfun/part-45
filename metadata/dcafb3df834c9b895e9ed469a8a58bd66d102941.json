This volume focuses on BritishÃ¢â‚¬â€œAmerican differences in the structure of words and sentences and supports them with computer-aided studies of large text collections. Present-day as well as earlier forms of the two varieties are included in the analyses. This makes it the first book-length treatment of British and American English grammar in contrast, with topics ranging from compound verbs to word order differences and tag questions. The authors explore some of the better-known contrasts, as well as a great variety of innovative themes that have so far received little or no consideration. Bringing together the work of a team of leading scholars in the field, this book will be of interest to those working within the fields of English historical linguistics, language variation and change, and dialectology.\n\n\nPaperback: 486 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press; Reissue edition (16 Dec 2010)\nLanguage English\nISBN-10: 0521183960\nISBN-13: 978-0521183963","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcafb3df834c9b895e9ed469a8a58bd66d102941","amp;dn":"One+Language%2C+Two+Grammars+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcafb3df834c9b895e9ed469a8a58bd66d102941","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,175,179,223,131,76,155,137,94,158,212,105,168,165,139,214,109,16,41,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
