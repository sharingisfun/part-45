The government wants to control them. Being a superhero has never been this hard, especially for Tempest.\n\nTwo months after the discovery of the powerful, non-Meta Recombinants, the former RangersÃ¢â‚¬â€Meta-powered humans dedicated to preserving the peaceÃ¢â‚¬â€have made no progress in uncovering the newcomers' origins, or convincing the public to trust them. Newly powered Metas are popping up and causing trouble, while the former BanesÃ¢â‚¬â€Metas who harm humans and create chaosÃ¢â‚¬â€show no inclination that they even want to leave the island prison of Manhattan. With a presidential election looming, the hot political debate is all about Meta rightsÃ¢â‚¬â€and whether they deserve to have any.\n\nStill haunted by the murder of so many in the Meta War fifteen years earlier, Ethan &quot;Tempest&quot; Swift accepts an assignment in Manhattan, working with a team that's interviewing Banes to determine which are still threats and which have reformed. But Ethan has a personal reason for going to the island as well. Armed with questions for the Bane who just might be his father, Ethan's quest for answers is interrupted by an unexpected assault on the island. Forced to side with old enemies to uncover who's responsible for the devastating attack, Ethan begins to question more than just his pastÃ¢â‚¬â€he questions his place in defending a world that sees him as its enemy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae3d8ea30dde82766738234f5bef9a39e7f62e2c","amp;dn":"Tempest+-+Kelly+Meding.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae3d8ea30dde82766738234f5bef9a39e7f62e2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,61,142,163,13,222,130,118,103,56,35,79,91,239,154,57,231,246,46,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
