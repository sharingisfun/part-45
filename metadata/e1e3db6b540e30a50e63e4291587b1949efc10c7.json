From the very simple beam to the most complex of multi-span beams with any combination of loads applied.\n\nThe great part of A-Beam is you are not limited to the only predefined of the pattern of the beams with particular support and load condition, but in A-Beam you can create your own beam with any combination of span and load condition no matter how complex it is.\n\nAnd create a beam and input the support and load condition is easy due to the interaction of the user interface which will show you the beam diagram while editing the data.\n\nBest for structural civil Engineer, Architect or students in structural analysis.\n\nKey Features:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Beam design &amp; analysis with any number of spans &amp; loads combinations.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Saved and listed all the previous beams by showing each beam's Free Body Diagram (F.B.D) on the main screen so user can select and access previous work easily.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Multi spans: no limit of number of spans of the beams (currently 3 types of support condition &quot;Hinge, Fixed End and Free&quot;).\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Load patterns: any combination of loads applied to each spans of the beam (currently 5 types of loads &quot;Point, Uniform, Triangular-Right, Triangular-Left and Moment load&quot; ).\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Results:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Reaction at each support\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Shear Force Diagram (S.F.D.)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Bending Moment Diagram (B.M.D.)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Deflection\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Reading the result (shear, bending moment and deflection) all along the beam length by tap &amp; move the tracing line along the beam.\n\nWhat's New\n- For the devices with Android 4.4 KitKat you can now prepare the results &amp; calculation sheets in PDF format.\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ananratana.abeam&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ananratana.abeam&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1e3db6b540e30a50e63e4291587b1949efc10c7","amp;dn":"A-Beam+v2.6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1e3db6b540e30a50e63e4291587b1949efc10c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,227,219,107,84,14,48,165,14,99,228,41,21,135,177,148,158,252,16,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
