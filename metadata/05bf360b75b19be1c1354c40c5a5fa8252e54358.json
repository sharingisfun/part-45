With chapters like &quot;The Burden of Government&quot; and &quot;The Economics of Democracy,&quot; Bernstein probes the future of an economy during rapidly changing times and the appropriate role of government in determining the ultimate outcome.\n\nThe questions have not changed over time, but Bernstein's answers help us understand these issues from today's perspective. How much government control is too much control? How much can government spend? How can government influence the level of unemployment?\n\nAs Bernstein shows how to navigate an ever-changing economic landscape, his timeless insights throughout these pages make The Price of Prosperity as vital and important today as when it appeared in an environment fundamentally different from our own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05bf360b75b19be1c1354c40c5a5fa8252e54358","amp;dn":"Peter+Bernstein+--+The+Price+of+Prosperity%3A+A+Realistic+Appraisa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05bf360b75b19be1c1354c40c5a5fa8252e54358","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,191,54,11,117,177,155,225,193,53,76,64,197,165,250,130,82,229,67,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
