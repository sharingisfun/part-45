Trent exhibits behavior towards Duncan that borders on emotional abuse by often making comments and gestures that are belittling and rude towards him. They arrive at the beach house and are greeted by the neighbors, hard-drinking Betty, and her children, Susanna and Peter. Duncan and Susanna have an awkward conversation from their adjacent porches.\n\nDuncan discovers a pink, sparkly &quot;girl's bike&quot; in the garage of the beach house and begins exploring the town. He eventually runs into the staff of the local water park, Water Wizz, at the local pizza joint. He has a brief interaction with the laid-back manager, Owen, who takes Duncan under his wing and shows him around the park. Duncan is introduced to the park's colourful, rag-tag group of employees: Caitlyn, Lewis, and Roddy. Several kids at the water park speak reverently of a legendary &quot;pass&quot; in the tube slide, wondering how it could have been done. Owen hires Duncan for odd jobs at the Water Wizz. Duncan views the water park as an escape from his unhappy life at the beach house.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:557608bf181ae9b524c24449e451705e2de642f1","amp;dn":"The+Way+Way+Back+2013+HDRip.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"557608bf181ae9b524c24449e451705e2de642f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,118,8,191,24,26,233,181,36,194,68,73,228,81,112,94,45,230,66,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
