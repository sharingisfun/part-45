However, the urge to reunite with her birth mother has never faded, triggering a search twenty-two years later that is shockingly successful.\n\nGail Dolgin and Vicente Franco's film is a heartbreaking tale that is at times almost unbearable to watch. Proving that culture has more to do with the shaping of an individual than innate physical characteristics, DAUGHTER FROM DANANG also works as a reminder to viewers that one should be careful what they wish for.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8657cf7ff79ead05cd7453f9bd954b5d5877d82","amp;dn":"Daughter+From+Danang+%28Documentary%2C+Vietnam+Adoption%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8657cf7ff79ead05cd7453f9bd954b5d5877d82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,101,124,247,255,121,234,208,92,215,69,63,155,217,84,181,213,135,125,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
