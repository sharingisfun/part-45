As a boy he toured and recorded with the familyquartet, in addition to visiting the United States (1916-26). His adult teachers were his father David, John Forsell (1928-30) and the Scottish tenor Joseph Hislop. He was a member of the Royal Opera in Stockholm from 1930, making his dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©but in the small rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´le of the Lamplighter in PucciniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Manon Lescaut. HisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“officialÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ first appearance was as Don Ottavio in MozartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Don Giovanni later that season. Two years later he began his international career in Germany, followed by Vienna (1936), Chicago (1937), the Metropolitan Opera in New York (1938) and Covent Garden the following year. He continued to appear regularly in New York, except in the war years, until 1959. BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rling was regarded as the foremost Italiansounding tenor of his day in the spinto rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´les of Puccini and Verdi, and he also excelled in French opera. His work was highly respected for its high artistic qualities, even if his acting ability was somewhat stilted and stiff. He recorded extensively from the mid-1930s until his early death in 1960. His poor health in later years was caused by heart problems.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussi_Bj%C3%B6rling&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussi_Bj%C3%B6rling&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussi_Bj%C3%B6rling&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussi_Bj%C3%B6rling&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTags contain recording date and location, composers and lyricist(s).
