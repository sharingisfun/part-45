Detective Inspector James Quill is about to complete the drugs bust of his career. Then his prize suspect Rob Toshack is murdered in custody. Furious, Quill pursues the investigation, co-opting intelligence analyst Lisa Ross and undercover cops Costain and Sefton. But nothing about ToshackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murder is normal. Toshack had struck a bargain with a vindictive entity, whose occult powers kept Toshack one step ahead of the law Ã¢â‚¬â€œ until his luck ran out. Now, the team must find a 'suspect' who can bend space and time and alter memory itself. And they will kill again. As the group starts to see LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sinister magic for themselves, they have two choices: panic or use their new abilities. Then they must hunt a terrifying supernatural force the only way they know how: using police methods, equipment and tactics. But they must all learn the rules of this new game - and quickly. More than their lives will depend on it.\nGenre: Urban Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e51254550ad5d3cb65c921c007e70c2f809eaf83","amp;dn":"London+Falling+%28Paul+Cornell%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e51254550ad5d3cb65c921c007e70c2f809eaf83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,18,84,85,10,213,211,203,101,201,33,192,7,231,12,47,128,158,175,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
