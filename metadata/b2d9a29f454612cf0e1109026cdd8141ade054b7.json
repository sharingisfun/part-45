With her debut album, BÃƒÂ©riaux offers 15 original jazzy titles that travel across jazz, pop, and soul with apparent influences of Madeleine Peyroux, Erykah Badu, Fiona Apple, Melody Gardot, and Anita O Day.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“(...) very sensual and jazzy, like a real vamp (...) She chose musicians with class who combine pop and jazz with perfection. Blow Up My World is a jazz record of a kind you would expect from Dani Klein. BÃƒÂ©riaux is at least as successful in the genreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (GTB - Brussel Deze Week)\nAs soon as the first notes arise, one is blown away, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mmmm, doo-i-doo-do-i-a.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The voice, its tone, its pose, its quality and color, the sound quality, the way the guitar blends in. Here is a vocal jazz album which is bound to please. One is not disappointed after listening to the 15 pieces. Blow Up My World is brilliantly put together. And one can't get enough. An unmistakable sign of quality.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Jean-Claude Vantroyen, Le Soir)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Albinoni's Ghost\n02 - Crowded Bar\n03 - Blow Up My World\n04 - Sixty Years Ago\n05 - Scat Cat\n06 - Behind Your Smile\n07 - Chaotic\n08 - Uluru\n09 - Magic Radio\n10 - Cezanne\n11 - I'll Rob a Bank\n12 - Mannequin\n13 - You Know Too Much\n14 - In My Bed\n15 - Unforgettable Thoughts\n\nPersonnel:\nFanny Beriaux - vocals\nJarek Frankowski - guitar\nSam Gerstmans - bass\nMatthieu Van - piano, Fender Rhodes\nJerome Baudart - drums\nJean-Paul Estievenart - trumpet\n\nEnjoy and share!
