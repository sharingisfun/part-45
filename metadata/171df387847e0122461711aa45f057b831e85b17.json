Trains on the NJ Transit North Jersey Coast Line operate over Amtrakâ€™s electrified Northeast Corridor to Rahway, then travel to what was once the famous â€œNew York &amp; Long Branchâ€ along the Atlantic seashore to the iconic New Jersey railroad towns named South Amboy, Long Branch, and Bay Head. NJ Transit is one of North Americaâ€™s largest and busiest commuter railroads, serving approximately 300,000 rail commuters and passengers each weekday. \r\n\r\nIncluded with the NJCL route is NJ Transitâ€™s ultra-modern and unique Bombardier ALP-45DP â€œdual-powerâ€ locomotive, which can operate either from overhead A. C. catenary or as a diesel-electric locomotive. It is capable of speeds over 100 mph. The route also features NJTâ€™s Comet IV commuter coach and a fully equipped, drivable Comet V cab car for push-pull operations.\r\n\r\nTHIS ADDON WILL NOT WORK ON LEGIT OF TRAIN SIMUALTOR 2016!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:171df387847e0122461711aa45f057b831e85b17","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2016+DTG+NJCL+Route+%2B+NJT+F40PH-2CAT+Twin+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"171df387847e0122461711aa45f057b831e85b17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,29,243,135,132,126,1,34,70,23,17,170,69,240,87,184,49,232,91,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
