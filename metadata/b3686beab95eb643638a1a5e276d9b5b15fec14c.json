The sequel is an expansive and bloody romp through Renaissance Italy that plays up every popular aspect of the first installment while righting many of its flaws. Assassin's Creed II has evolved from an ill-defined action game into a fully featured open world experience. Everything from the new monetary system to the ability to buy armor and weapons makes it a richer, and ultimately more satisfying game than its predecessor.\n\nThe plot of Assassin's Creed pulls together a bit of The Matrix, a lot of historical fiction, and throws in elements of the madcap conspiracy theories found in a Dan Brown novel. The series also has the benefit of being crafted by some of the most talented hands in game development. With only a handful of exceptions, the environments, animations, and art are beautifully portrayed. In addition to its good looks, the sequel's gameplay builds so much upon the foundations of the first game, that in retrospect, the first Assassin's Creed looks like little more than a technical demonstration.\\\\\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3686beab95eb643638a1a5e276d9b5b15fec14c","amp;dn":"Assassins.Creed.II.Official.Game.Guide+%5BPDF%5D+%5Buber%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3686beab95eb643638a1a5e276d9b5b15fec14c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,104,107,234,185,94,182,67,99,138,26,94,39,109,155,91,21,254,193,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
