It demonstrates that many of the claims are myths, presenting evidence in support of and in opposition to them in an accessible yet academically rigorous manner. The book combines an easy-to-read overview of the subject with innovative new research. It tackles head-on questions about levels of immigration, the contribution of immigrants, minority self-segregation, ghettoisation and the future diversity of the population. The authors argue that the myths of race and migration are the real threat to an integrated society and recommend that focus should return to problems of inequality and prejudice.\n\n\nReview\nIf you want to know what has really been happening in Britain in terms of ethnic segregation, how many ghettos exist, or whether immigration is a threat to social solidarity, this is the book to read. Danny Dorling, Professor of Human Geography, University of Sheffield\n\n\nIn an area where unwarranted generalisations and myths are all too common, and derive their plausibility from the current climate of moral panic, this well-researched and carefully argued book represents a welcome contribution. Based on a consistent line of thought, it should do much to improve the quality of public discourse on this vexed subject. It might provoke disagreement from time to time, and that reinforces its value. Lord Bhikhu Parekh, Professor of Political Philosophy, University of Westminster\n\n\nNissa Finney and Ludi Simpson have produced an authoritative guide to evidence on immigration and segregation, in plain language. This book will help journalists and politicians to treat these issues with the seriousness they deserve, and hesitate before making alarmist claims that have no basis in fact. Jon Cruddas, MP\n\n\n..a very accessible, easy-to-read counter-argument to the many ill-informed headline-grabbing race and immigration 'factoids'... Joy Thompson, LariaNews\n\n\nAn accessible and authoritative book which is much needed and hits the spot admirably.
