Determined to claim family homes as their own, these invaders use overwhelming numbers, sustained attacks and the threat of disease to conquer houses and apartments. Homes become battlegrounds, leaving their human victims with no place to hide. First-hand accounts and dramatic recreations reveal the pain and anguish of each family s fight to reclaim their homes as their own, but no matter what the outcome, home will never feel the same again.\n\n\n1)  Crawls from the Walls \nIn Tennessee, a married couple and their two children settle down to life in a rural area, where they start finding many bugs. Initially, it doesn't seem like a problem, until a brown recluse spider enters. Suddenly, the husband/father receives a bite that turns out to be so serious that it forces him to go to the hospital. Knowing there are many more spiders in the house, the family attempts to get rid of them with pest control treatments. In Pennsylvania, another family of four have been enjoying life in a close-knit community. However, they notice that one house in their neighbourhood is rather unkempt and its residents isolate themselves. As if that isn't unsettling enough, the family discovers German cockroaches spreading from the neighbours' house to theirs. In Georgia, a college student moves back home with his parents. Everyone tries to adjust to life in the south, but they soon learn that bedbugs have invaded their house. Throwing out the bedroom couch and getting an exterminator's help seems to be the solution, but the bedbugs continue to give the family problems\n\n  \n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/356/f2qg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/356/f2qg.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/5971/siyy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/5971/siyy.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4381/b0mk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4381/b0mk.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/8523/s8qx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/8523/s8qx.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4807/9ob7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4807/9ob7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/5018/ff7u.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/5018/ff7u.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/3710/axbj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/3710/axbj.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/6697/qrhx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/6697/qrhx.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/8436/8kg2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/8436/8kg2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3179585659717d021f00&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2130 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps CBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 7\n * Part Size: 667 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/infested&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/infested&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Infested%21%20Series%201&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Infested%21%20Series%201&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:970d8ec571ad1673f3bee8c0c24952b24e234ab6","amp;dn":"Infested+Series+2+1of7+Crawls+from+the+Walls+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"970d8ec571ad1673f3bee8c0c24952b24e234ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,13,142,197,113,173,22,115,243,190,232,192,194,73,82,178,78,35,74,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
