Exiled from his guild he is an outcast, but his travels are woven with strange portents. The Claw of the Conciliator, relic of a prophet and promise of a new age, flames to life in his hands. He carries the great sword Terminus Est, the Line of Division. The dwellers in the deep waters offer him a kingdom under the seas. And he is hunted and driven by terrors from beyond Urth.\r\n\r\nNow all his travels move him inexorably toward a grander fate, a destiny that he dare not refuse. For a devouring blackness gnaws at the heart of the Old Sun, and the fate of Urth rests in the return of the Conciliator, the New Sun long foretold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrated by: Jonathan Davis\r\nLength: 11 hrs and 5 mins \r\nFormat: M4A\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:01-12-10\r\nPublisher: Audible Studios","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86adea3e868bebcc96cfb4fee802de6e7eae32cd","amp;dn":"Gene+Wolfe+-+The+Citadel+of+the+Autarch+%28The+Book+of+the+New+Sun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86adea3e868bebcc96cfb4fee802de6e7eae32cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,173,234,62,134,139,235,204,150,207,180,254,232,2,222,110,126,174,50,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
