In 29 years, the seemingly impenetrable federal penitentiary, which housed Al Capone and &quot;Birdman&quot; Robert Stroud, was only broken once -by three men never heard of again. Eastwood portrays Frank Morris, the cunning bank robber who masterminded the elaborately detailed and, as far as anyone knows, ultimately successful, escape. Patrick McGoohan is a superb counterpoint as the suspicious warden. Filmed on location in Alcatraz, this gritty and realistic reenactment of a true story has all the power one expects of an Eastwood/Siegel movie. \n\n\nDirector Don Siegel \nCast Clint Eastwood, Patrick McGoohan, Roberts Blossom, Larry Hankin, Jack Thibeau, Fred Ward, Paul Benjamin, Bruce M.
