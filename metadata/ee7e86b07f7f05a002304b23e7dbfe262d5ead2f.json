his  mouth. He\n        could have been anything but he chose a life of crime. By  his\n        early 20s he had made the Interpol Top Ten Most Wanted list.\n\n        His partner  in crime  happened to  be the  love of  his life,\n        Clelia  Vigano,  the  daughter  of  a  respectable   Melbourne\n        restauranteur.\n\n        Together McMilland and Clelia were an unstoppable force  until\n        she lost her life in  a prison fire. McMillan blamed  himself,\n        and the guilt spurred him on to even greater risks.\n\n        His personal journey ended in Thailand's notorious Klong  Prem\n        Central  Prison  -the   &quot;Bangkok  HIlton&quot;-  facing   a  firing\n        squad...Or did it?\n\n     \n                                           \n                   RIP NOTES                     \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n    [NUKE] Underbelly.Files.The.Man.Who.Got.Away.DVDRip.XviD-BWB [bad.crc]\n\n                       Proof pic in sample directory\n\n                                    Enjoy!\n\n     \n                                           \n               GROUP INFORMATION                 \n        10 Years of the Force and still        \n                     going strong                      \n     \n\n        What we are looking for:\n\n        * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n        * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n        * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee7e86b07f7f05a002304b23e7dbfe262d5ead2f","amp;dn":"Underbelly.Files.The.Man.Who.Got.Away.PROPER.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee7e86b07f7f05a002304b23e7dbfe262d5ead2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,126,134,176,127,127,5,160,2,48,75,35,231,219,254,38,45,94,173,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
