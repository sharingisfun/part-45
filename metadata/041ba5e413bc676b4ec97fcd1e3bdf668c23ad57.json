It forms the ground-work of thorough study in all Medical Subjects. This book aims at providing a synopsis of the Method of Examining a Patient and to teach the student how to obtain an accurate history of the illness and what he should look for to arrive at a diagnosis in a logical manner.\r\nHistory taking is an art which must be acquired by experience. No detail is unimportant, and the correct diagnosis often rests upon a careful balancing of probabilities. A first class history is a necessary prelude to an accurate diagnosis. In fact, a well-elaborated anamnesis practically establishes the diagnosis in several cases. The converse is also trueâ€”a history taken hurriedly and aimlessly without any data or properly obtained facts, is not only valueless, but often highly misleading.\r\nTime spent in questioning the patient intelligently is never lost, but the type of questions to ask needs experience. This is best acquired by constant clinical examination, for which read-ing this book is only an accessory and not a substitute. Some are endowed with a gift of extracting concise and accurate history from a patient. Such students learn more readily than others, but the gift can certainly be acquired by anyone who possesses the necessary will to learn. This book is mainly intended for those who are not gifted with this art and the author hopes it will help them in their careers both as students and after.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nCHAPTER I - GENERAL SCHEME\r\nCHAPTER II - RESPIRATORY SYSTEM\r\nCHAPTER III - CARDIO-VASCUlAR SYSTEM\r\nCHAPTER IV - ALIMENTARY SYSTEM\r\nCHAPTER V - CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM\r\nCHAPTER VI - GENITOURINARY SYSTEM\r\nCHAPTER VII - HAEMOPOlETlC SYSTEM\r\nCHAPTER vIII - LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM\r\nCHAPTER IX - SKIN AND ITS APPENDAGES\r\nCHAPTER X - EXAMINATION OF CHILDREN\r\nCHAPTER XI - EXAMINATION OF PSYCHIATRlC PATIENTS\r\nAPPENDICES\r\nINDEX\r\n \nhttp://s7.postimg.org/t2mmqsgzf/How_to_Examine_a_Patient.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:041ba5e413bc676b4ec97fcd1e3bdf668c23ad57","amp;dn":"How+to+Examine+a+Patient+%28erd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"041ba5e413bc676b4ec97fcd1e3bdf668c23ad57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,27,165,228,19,188,103,107,78,201,127,205,30,59,223,102,140,35,173,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
