The 1970s and 1980s saw a boom in television programming as the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting invited independent producers and directors to shoot television serials on a regular basis.\nHum log,Buniyaad, Nukkad, Karamchand Jasoos were some of the memorable serials of this era. Malgudi Days was one such television serial which left an indelible mark on the Indian television scenario.\n\nBased on the collection of short stories penned by acclaimed author, R.K.Narayan, the serial narrated focused on the trial and tribulations of a small Indian town of Malgudi. According to R.K. Narayan, \nMalgudi is a town &quot;habited by timeless characters who could be living anywhere in the world&quot; and is located on the banks of river Sarayu and surrounded by the Mempi Hills.\n\nThe serial was directed by acclaimed Kannada actor, director Late Shankar Nag and was shot entirely near Agumbe in Shimoga District, Karnataka. The music was rendered by L. Vaidyanathan and was produced by T.S. Narasimhan of the Padam Rag Fims. It included many of Narayan's short stories and novels like &quot;Swami and Friends&quot; and &quot;Vendor of Sweets&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n=================================================\nMalgudi Days - Swamy And Friends  - Episode 1- 8\n================================================\n\n\nSwami and Friends revolves around ten-year old Swaminathan, or Swami as he is known by other characters. \nSwami portrays the growing pangs of a boy who despises school, as he makes excuses and roams around Malgudi with his friends. \nSwami's father works in a government office and his mother is a housewife. At home, \nSwami shares his adventures with his aged granny, who lovingly addresses him as &quot;Chamy.&quot; \nSwami also has two close friends: Mani and the son of the Police Chief Superintendent, Rajam. \n\n\nCharachters: \n===========\n\n    W.S.Swaminathan (Swamy) - Master Manjunath\n\n    Swami's father - Girish Karnad\n\n    Swami's mother - Vaishali Kasaravalli\n\n    Swami's grand mother - B Jayashree\n\n    Mani - Raghuram\n\n    Rajam - Rohit Shrinath\n\n    Somu - Chetan\n\n\nMusic - Sharang Dev\n\nProsucer - T.S.Narsimhan\n\nDirector - Shankar Nag\n\n\n\n\n\n-----\nInfo:-\n-----\n\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media / Version 2\nCodec ID                                 : mp42\nFile size                                : 90-100 MB/Episdoe\nDuration                                 : 22-23 mins\n\n\n\nVideo\n-----\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nDuration                         : 22-23 mins\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 474 Kbps\nWidth                            : 480 pixels\nHeight                           : 360 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.850\nFrame rate mode                  : Constant\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nCredits                          : Intact\n\nAudio\n-----\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                   : LC\nDuration                         : 22-23 mins\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 96.0 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R \nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nLanguage                         : Hindi\n\nSubtitles\n---------\nUnavailable :(\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SAJFKZi.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SAJFKZi.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UCqBdcY.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UCqBdcY.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ONJfWUb.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ONJfWUb.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bmAPnJQ.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bmAPnJQ.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uEzNc1s.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uEzNc1s.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LlT8kw8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LlT8kw8.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/baQ7Jvl.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/baQ7Jvl.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7FkLZyU.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7FkLZyU.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\nPC, WDTV, Playstation, Xbox 360, Samsung Tablet, Amazon Kindle, Apple ipad, Apple iphone and other Android Devices\n\n\n\n\n===========================\n--------------------------\nPlease Seed After Download \n--------------------------\n===========================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cdc05388e054ccf6587b9a1d1ef97014ea78a7a","amp;dn":"Malgudi+Days+-+%5BEp+1-+8%5D-+480p+-+Swamy+And+Friends+-+IndianNeo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cdc05388e054ccf6587b9a1d1ef97014ea78a7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,220,5,56,142,5,76,207,101,135,185,161,209,239,151,1,78,167,138,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
