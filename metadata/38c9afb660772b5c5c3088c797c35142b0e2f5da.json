Her husband Takashi (Tadahiko Sugano), owner of a securities company, has been having an affair and comes home only once in a week at most. In a poetry party, Oriko meets sculptor Mitsuharu (Isao Kimura), who was one of the lovers of OrikoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s deceased poetess mother. Oriko has been ashamed of her motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s decadent morality but she now has a strange intimate feeling for Mitsuharu. One day, Oriko goes to the seaside with her sister-in-law Yuko (Shigako Shimegi) and her friends. In the evening, Oriko witnesses Yuko being violated by a construction worker. Yuko first resists the manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s advances but later enjoys in bliss, which in turn ignites OrikoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s suppressed desire. A few days later, Oriko visits the construction worker and tries to persuade him to leave Yuko, only to be violated by the worker herself. However, Oriko doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have the pleasure she expected, but instead sees herself as decadent as her mother. Oriko tells her strange encounters to Mitsuharu, who advises Oriko to have a divorce. The two meet from time to time and develop a Platonic relationship. One day, when Oriko visits Mitsuharu in a hotel room, Takashi suddenly appears and accuses his wife of being unfaithful. Oriko pleads for a divorce but is rejected. However, when Oriko confesses her encounter with the construction worker, her embittered husband promptly agrees to divorce. After that, Oriko makes love to Mitsuharu for the first time. Later, Mitsuharu is crushed by his own giant stone sculpture and suffers from severe injuries, and may be impotent for life. Nevertheless, Oriko insists on taking care of him out of faith and love.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/j1-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/j1-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/j2-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/j2-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/j3-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/j3-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/j4-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/j4-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----my rip----\n\n~~~~~~ Joen.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,163,151,360                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:32:57                \nFrame Count:....................................139417             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................256                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................2.500                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1530                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.374&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................128                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2    \n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
