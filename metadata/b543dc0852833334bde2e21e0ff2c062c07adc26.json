A shorter, 6-track version of the EP was originally given out for free by the band.\n\nTwo songs were changed upon the release of their debut album Lovers' Requiem: the early versions of &quot;Pretty People Never Lie, Vampires Never Really Die&quot; and &quot;We Are Always Searching&quot;. The bridge of the final version of &quot;Pretty People Never Lie, Vampires Never Really Die&quot; was altered with Kerith Telestai's vocals taking a main part.\nThe song &quot;Lady Madeline in Her Coffin&quot; is in reference to the short story by Edgar Allan Poe entitled &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] The Dead Girl Epilogue (Part 1)\n[02] Pretty People Never Lie - Vampires Never Really Die\n[03] We Are Always Searching\n[04] Eulogies And Epitaphs\n[05] The Most Beautiful Nightmare (Part 2)\n[06] Kiss Me Like You Wanted - We Will Never Tell\n[07] Lady Madeline In Her Coffin\n[08] Civil War And Isolation Thirst\n[09] The Last Goodbye Of Smile And Bone\n \n\n\t \n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time \t\t- 00h:40m:37s\n\nTotal File Size \t\t\t- 99.2mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t\t\t- I-Tunes v8.1.1.10 MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t\t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t\t- Goth Rock \n\nRelease Date\t\t\t- 25 October 2005\n\nRecord Company\t\t\t- Epitaph Europe\n\nArtists WebSite\t\t\t- http://www.iamghostmusic.com \n\t\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b543dc0852833334bde2e21e0ff2c062c07adc26","amp;dn":"%5B2005%5D+We+Are+Always+Searching+-+I+Am+Ghost+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b543dc0852833334bde2e21e0ff2c062c07adc26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,67,220,8,82,131,51,52,189,226,226,30,15,242,192,98,192,122,220,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
