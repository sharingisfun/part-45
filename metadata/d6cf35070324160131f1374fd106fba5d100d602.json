Their careers exemplified the remarkable Roman achievements and the brutal, corrupt nature of the Roman system. From Julius Caesar and Caesar Augustus, whose reigns predated Christianity, this series traces six centuries of Roman rule through Nero, Hadrian, Constantine, and Justinian.\n\nTheir careers were made up of bloody battles and tactical bribery, stunning innovation and profound corruption, dazzling rhetoric and vicious back-stabbing. Together they form a picture of the most sophisticated highs and most brutal lows of the Roman Empire's inception, heyday and decline. The Roman Empire included within its boundaries myriad peoples, cultures and climates. The task of ruling it seems an impossible one, even with today's communication technology. So how was it achieved two thousand years ago? And why has ancient Rome had such a profound influence on western civilization ever since?\n\nUsing unequalled location footage, previously unseen images and careful re-enactments, this informative and entertaining series brings to life the world of ancient Rome.\n\nWriter &amp; Director: Phil Grabsky. Co-Director: Peter Nicholson.\n\nSeries originally made for the BBC and A&amp;E.\n\n\n\n\n===contents================\n\nI Caesar - Ep1 Julius Caesar\nI Caesar - Ep2 Augustus\nI Caesar - Ep3 Nero\nI Caesar - Ep4 Hadrian\nI Caesar - Ep5 Constantine\nI Caesar - Ep6 Justinian\n\n\n\n\n\nexample of the technical specifications\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: I Caesar - Ep1 Julius Caesar.avi\nFilesize.....: 480 MB (or 492,161 KB or 503,973,362 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:49:14 (88,531 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1197 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 160 kb/s (80/ch, stereo) CBR \nFrame Size...: 720x480 (1.50:1) [=3:2]\nLanguage.....: English\nSubtitles....: None posted\nSource.......: Unknown (Not My Rip) - I think it's from DVD  \n\ntotal runtime approx 300 minutes\ntotal filesize approx 2.8 G\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso of possible interest if you haven't seen it already - the HBO/BBC drama series &quot;Rome&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrents.thepiratebay.se/4638175/Rome-Season_1___2.4638175.TPB.torrent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrents.thepiratebay.se/4638175/Rome-Season_1___2.4638175.TPB.torrent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrents.thepiratebay.se/4848205/Rome_Season_2_DVDRip_XviD_FoV.4848205.TPB.torrent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrents.thepiratebay.se/4848205/Rome_Season_2_DVDRip_XviD_FoV.4848205.TPB.torrent&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n \n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6cf35070324160131f1374fd106fba5d100d602","amp;dn":"I%2C+Caesar+%281997%29+The+Rise+and+Fall+of+the+Roman+Empire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6cf35070324160131f1374fd106fba5d100d602","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,207,53,7,3,36,22,1,49,241,55,79,209,6,251,165,209,0,214,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
