Pacific City is being strangled by crime and the only hope is the Agency and its genetically enhanced agents. In a world of revolutionary scale, explore Pacific City's full width, depth, and height as you fight crime by any means necessary. Pull off impossible stunts like insane leaps, super-human speed, bone-shattering blows, impossible vehicular maneuvers, and other moves you'll have to see to believe. Add over 100 licensed songs, doubly intense co-op play, and more, and the war-on-crime game has officially evolved. You ready?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8338b41503e21c4863adb7713639ae6ac06f844","amp;dn":"Crackdown+RF+Xbox+360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8338b41503e21c4863adb7713639ae6ac06f844","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,51,139,65,80,62,33,196,134,58,219,119,19,99,154,230,172,6,248,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
