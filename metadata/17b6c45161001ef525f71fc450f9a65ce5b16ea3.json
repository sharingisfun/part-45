The plug-ins produce no sound themselves, nor do they process sound - rather, they generate signals to be used as control voltages (CVs), which can be patched into the control inputs of oscillators, filters, VCAs etc. of an analogue system. Also, with the addition of the CV Input plug-in, it is possible to bring CVs from the synth into the computer, for recording or processing.\n\nThere are currently eighteen plug-ins in the Silent Way suite - Silent Way AC Encoder, Silent Way CV Input, Silent Way CV To MIDI, Silent Way CV To OSC , Silent Way DC, Silent Way ES-4 Controller, Silent Way ES-5 Controller, Silent Way ESX-4CV Combiner, Silent Way Follower, Silent Way Learner, Silent Way LFO, Silent Way Quantizer, Silent Way SMUX, Silent Way Soundplane, Silent Way Step LFO, Silent Way Sync , Silent Way Trigger and Silent Way Voice Controller. These are described in more detail below. It is anticipated that more plug-ins will be added to the suite in the future - watch the website for product announcements.\n\n\nTutorials\n\nVarious videos and instructions for using Silent Way with particular hosts or modules are collected here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.expert-sleepers.co.uk/siwatutorials.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.expert-sleepers.co.uk/siwatutorials.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n   Windows\n       Windows XP SP2 or Windows 7\n       VST 2.4 host application\n       Silent Way v2 supports 32 or 64 bit.\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Unistall any previus versions\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Next open the .rar file by double clicking it.
