(Fraunhofer CBR 32 kbit/s 22050 Hz Mono).\n\n\nThe plot is simple, the characters memorable, and the clues, motives, and suspects pure Christie in this wonderful mystery that takes place at an English boarding school for girls. A young prince of a Middle East kingdom is killed in a flying accident and leaves behind a valuable collection of jewels to be smuggled into England by his friend Bob Rawlinson. It is believed the jewels will turn up at Meadowbank School since not only the prince's sister but also the sister and niece of Bob Rawlinson are all students there. Not surprisingly, murder takes place at the prestigious school. Everyone from the headmistress and teachers to the students and parents are suspects until Poirot's clever little grey cells solve the mystery.
