Then:\n\n\nI just converted this one from the PS2 Version, from Yo!Toobe actually.\n\nThe're both 4:3 and 16:9 aspect screens, good sound, medium video quality.\n\n\nIf you see no seeders, try downloading even so... It shows none for me too.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDescription EDIT: There's no secret, but... i forgot on the Install.txt\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOW TO INSTALL:\n\n1. Go to: &quot;-&quot;  Means the separating bar that TPB delete on the text ... o.O ???\n\n... - Rockstar Games - GTA Liberty City Stories PC Edition beta 3.1.1 - Movies\n\n2. Delete or rename to whatever you want the file &quot;logo.mpg&quot; (ex.: 1logo.mpg)\nThat's why you get an black screen, it's in a diferent compression of the game.\n\n3. Rename the file &quot;gtatitles.mpg&quot; to &quot;logo,mpg&quot; - it will be like the R* logo.\n\n4. Copy the &quot;NEW&quot; &quot;gtatitles,mpg&quot;(actual intro) on the &quot;Movies&quot; folder.\n\n5. Run the game, you must see the &quot;LCS Team&quot; and them three R* logos and the Intro.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccae4b1c8936afe644081398a377262b66004fed","amp;dn":"GTA+Liberty+City+Stories+PC+Version+Intro+Addon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccae4b1c8936afe644081398a377262b66004fed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,174,75,28,137,54,175,230,68,8,19,152,163,119,38,43,102,0,79,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
