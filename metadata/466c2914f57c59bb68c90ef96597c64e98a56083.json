Directed by Charles Kaufman (brother of Troma President Lloyd Kaufman), the classic MotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Day delivers laughs and chills with liberal doses of nail-biting suspense. When three college buddies decide to rekindle their comraderie with a camping trip, they become the unwitting prey of a very dysfunctional family. As unforgettable as Deliverance, as terrifying as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre with a twisted statirical humor in the Kaufman vein, this Mother's Day will leave you feeling frightened and amazed! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:466c2914f57c59bb68c90ef96597c64e98a56083","amp;dn":"Mother%5C%27s+day+%5BDivX%5D%5BDVDrip%5D+Troma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"466c2914f57c59bb68c90ef96597c64e98a56083","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,108,41,20,245,124,89,187,104,201,14,249,101,151,198,78,152,165,96,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
