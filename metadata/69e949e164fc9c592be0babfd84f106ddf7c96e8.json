It's an all ages comic that includes a bit of steampunk, a pinch of diesel punk, western, and fantasy. Its biggest influences are The Wizard of Oz and Firefly. The &quot;funk&quot; in the title serves a dual purpose referring to the musical references throughout the story as well as the state of the world the characters exist in. The story will follow the adventures of a gutsy delivery girl, Deaux, as she unravels truths that she may not be prepared for.\n\nThanks goes to Nothing for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69e949e164fc9c592be0babfd84f106ddf7c96e8","amp;dn":"Steamfunk+000+%282012%29+%28Digital%29+%28Nothing-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69e949e164fc9c592be0babfd84f106ddf7c96e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,233,73,225,100,252,156,89,43,224,186,191,216,79,16,109,223,124,150,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
