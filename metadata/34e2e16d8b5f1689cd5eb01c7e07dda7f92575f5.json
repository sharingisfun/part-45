So do listeners.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34e2e16d8b5f1689cd5eb01c7e07dda7f92575f5","amp;dn":"The+Dennis+Prager+Radio+Show+MAY-17-2012+THURS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34e2e16d8b5f1689cd5eb01c7e07dda7f92575f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,226,225,109,139,95,22,137,205,94,176,28,126,7,221,167,249,37,117,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
