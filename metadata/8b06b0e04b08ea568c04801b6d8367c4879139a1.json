It is also a film about the ÃƒÂ¢??Polish experienceÃƒÂ¢??, but one made by a filmmaker too young to remember the War. It was made in 1971, before the so-called Polish ÃƒÂ¢??cinema of moral concernÃƒÂ¢?? of Holland, Kieslowski and Zanussi. It is based (in part) on the life of Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â»uÃƒâ€¦?awskiÃƒÂ¢??s father, Miroslaw, during the Second World War. It is perhaps the first (and probably the last) film about Weigl Institute in Lwow. But above all else, it is the debut film of one of cinemaÃƒÂ¢??s true visionaries.\n\nExcerpt from Daniel Bird essay found in the liner notes\n\n\nWorld War II Poland: a man gets a second chance. Michal&amp;#039;s wife and child are killed by German soldiers, but in a nearby town he discovers and stays with a woman in labour who looks just like his dead wife. A complex and surreal work, the film is obsessed with the distinctions between love as self-preservation and self-sacrifice. But it&amp;#039;s just as much the hallucinations of a dying man. Images of death are everywhere: endless corridors, figures framed in doorways (and later in coffins), a couple gunned down in bed. Not an easy film to come to terms with because of its cerebral nature and its self-consciousness; a haunting first feature, all the same.
