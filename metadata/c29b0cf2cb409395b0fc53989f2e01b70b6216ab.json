This course will reveal the &quot;secret sauce&quot; that makes a character memorable, beloved, villainous, funny, or celebrated.

She shows how body shape, posture, anatomy, facial expression, costume, color, movement, and abstract aspects like archetypes and environment bring a character to life. The lessons are illustrated with examples from Mary Jane's books, as well as famous, heart-warming characters created by a group of extraordinary character designers.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tCapturing the heart and soul of a character\r\n\tâ€¢\tUsing the right t\r\n\tâ€¢\tools\r\n\tâ€¢\tRelying on archetypes\r\n\tâ€¢\tAdding motion\r\n\tâ€¢\tPainting shapes and silhouettes\r\n\tâ€¢\tUnderstanding anatomy and proportion\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating easy-to-read facial expressions\r\n\tâ€¢\tColoring your character\r\n\tâ€¢\tDesigning a cast of characters\r\n\tâ€¢\tMaking fantasy creatures believable\r\n\tâ€¢\tGoing from 2D to 3D\r\n\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c29b0cf2cb409395b0fc53989f2e01b70b6216ab","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Character+Development+and+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c29b0cf2cb409395b0fc53989f2e01b70b6216ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,155,12,242,203,64,147,149,176,252,83,152,159,46,1,183,11,98,22,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
