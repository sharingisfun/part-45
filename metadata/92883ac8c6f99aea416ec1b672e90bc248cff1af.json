To pass you have to accomplish at least 75% of the mission goal. If you don&amp;#039;t pass it still shows you what job you will end up with. One of the simulator missions is the dreaded Kobayashi Maru, while others are based on the exploits of Kirk&amp;#039;s Enterprise. For instance, there is a simulation recreation of Battle of the Mutara Nebula, that Captain Kirk notes ruefully is used to reinforce the need to take the proper defensive precautions when encountering a non-communicative ship he neglected in the actual incident.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92883ac8c6f99aea416ec1b672e90bc248cff1af","amp;dn":"Star+Trek%3A+Starfleet+Academy+%5BClassic%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92883ac8c6f99aea416ec1b672e90bc248cff1af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,136,58,200,198,249,154,234,65,110,193,182,114,233,11,194,72,207,241,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
