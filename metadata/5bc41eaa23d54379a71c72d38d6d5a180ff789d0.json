It reunited the previous line-up including Eddie Hardin and Pete York, after they released 3 albums as &quot;Hardin &amp; York&quot;. Unfortunately all I could find was a now-dead torrent of this single-file version, and I wasn't able to split it into individual tracks.  It isn't as good as their 1960s albums, but definitely worth saving :\n\n\n\t1. Catch You On The Rebop\t\n\n\t2. Don't Let It Bring You Down\t\n\n\t3.
